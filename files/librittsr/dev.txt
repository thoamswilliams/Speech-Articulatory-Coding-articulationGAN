2902_9006_000023_000002.wav|Monastic isolation from family and national duties especially fitted the fathers of that period for the task, by giving them leisure, if nothing else, to face questions with a lifelong earnestness impossible to the more social and practical Northern mind.
2902_9006_000011_000000.wav|For somewhat more than four hundred years, the Roman Empire and the Christian Church, born into the world almost at the same moment, had been developing themselves side by side as two great rival powers, in deadly struggle for the possession of the human race.
2902_9006_000007_000000.wav|PREFACE
2902_9006_000008_000001.wav|It has to represent a very hideous, though a very great, age; one of those critical and cardinal eras in the history of the human race, in which virtues and vices manifest themselves side by side-even, at times, in the same person-with the most startling openness and power.
2902_9006_000010_000000.wav|For a time had arrived, in which no teacher who did not put forth the most lofty pretensions to righteousness could expect a hearing.
2902_9006_000008_000000.wav|A picture of life in the fifth century must needs contain much which will be painful to any reader, and which the young and innocent will do well to leave altogether unread.
2902_9006_000025_000001.wav|I can only say that I have laboured honestly and industriously to discover the truth, even in its minutest details, and to sketch the age, its manners and its literature, as I found them altogether artificial, slipshod, effete, resembling far more the times of Louis Quinze than those of Sophocles and Plato.
2902_9006_000020_000001.wav|Their vanguard, confined with difficulty for three centuries beyond the Eastern Alps, at the expense of sanguinary wars, had been adopted wherever it was practicable, into the service of the Empire; and the heart's core of the Roman legion was composed of Gothic officers and soldiers.
2902_9006_000020_000002.wav|But now the main body had arrived.
2902_9006_000019_000000.wav|And the new blood, at the era of this story, was at hand.
2902_9006_000000_000000.wav|This is a LibriVox recording.
2902_9006_000020_000000.wav|And their strength was felt at once.
2902_9006_000014_000005.wav|So thought many then, and, as I believe, not unwisely.
2902_9006_000010_000003.wav|And He who excited the craving, was also furnishing that which would satisfy it; and was teaching mankind, by a long and painful education, to distinguish the truth from its innumerable counterfeits, and to find, for the first time in the world's life, a good news not merely for the select few, but for all mankind without respect of rank or race.
2902_9006_000014_000001.wav|Here and there an abuse was lopped off; or an edict was passed for the visitation of prisons and for the welfare of prisoners; or a Theodosius was recalled to justice and humanity for a while by the stern rebukes of an Ambrose.
2902_9006_000017_000001.wav|They brought before the minds of churchmen a thousand new questions which must be solved, unless the Church was to relinquish for ever her claims as the great teacher and satisfier of the human soul.
2902_9006_000020_000005.wav|How iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of Theodosius, in refusing the usual bounty, by which the Goths were bribed not to attack the Empire!--The whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of Italy, and the Western Empire became from that day forth a dying idiot, while the new invaders divided Europe among themselves.
2902_9006_000022_000002.wav|That very peculiar turn of the Graeco Eastern mind, which made them the great thinkers of the then world, had the effect of drawing them away from practice to speculation; and the races of Egypt and Syria were effeminate, over civilised, exhausted by centuries during which no infusion of fresh blood had come to renew the stock.

2902_9006_000020_000006.wav|The fifteen years before the time of this tale had decided the fate of Greece; the last four that of Rome itself.
2902_9006_000008_000004.wav|In the present case that disadvantage is doubled; for while the sins of the Church, however heinous, were still such as admit of being expressed in words, the sins of the heathen world, against which she fought, were utterly indescribable; and the Christian apologist is thus compelled, for the sake of decency, to state the Church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve.
2902_9008_000001_000003.wav|School after school, they had all walked, and taught, and sung there, beneath the spreading planes and chestnuts, figs and palm trees.
2902_9008_000008_000002.wav|I will ask the prefect to find out who she is, and get rid of her, before she fascinates me with that evil eye.
2902_9008_000032_000004.wav|However, I got rid of them; quoted all the geographical lies I had ever heard, and a great many more; quickened their appetite for their fool's errand notably, and started them off again.
2902_9008_000002_000001.wav|There it towered up, the wonder of the world, its white roof bright against the rainless blue; and beyond it, among the ridges and pediments of noble buildings, a broad glimpse of the bright blue sea.

2902_9008_000014_000004.wav|That is my bitterest grief! to see those who have been pretending in the morning lecture room to worship every word of mine as an oracle, lounging in the afternoon round Pelagia's litter; and then at night-for I know that they do it-the dice, and the wine, and worse.
2902_9008_000038_000000.wav|'Well, my dear lady, and has not the villainous demagogue got the whole mob on his side?

2902_9008_000024_000002.wav|It is really a great comfort to a statesman that the masses are so well aware that they deserve hanging, and therefore so careful to prevent any danger of public justice depopulating the province.

2902_9008_000057_000002.wav|The consequence is clear.
2902_9008_000054_000001.wav|How the finances of the provinces would go on without their kind assistance, I dare not think.

2902_9008_000048_000003.wav|For aught I know or care, the plot may be an exactly opposite one, and the Christians intend to murder all the Jews.

2277_149896_000021_000001.wav|He'd take it to her-he would go up there and have a talk with her, and that at once.
2277_149896_000003_000002.wav|He would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble.

2277_149896_000003_000006.wav|She would find out at once just what advantages she could gain.
2277_149896_000002_000002.wav|While he was not sure how much significance might be attached to the threat she had made, he was sure that her attitude, if long continued, would cause him no end of trouble.

2277_149896_000016_000010.wav|These were his first thoughts.

2277_149896_000025_000000.wav|By the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself, that he could see his way out.
2277_149896_000026_000003.wav|Finally, seeing that no one was coming, he turned and went back to his cab.
2277_149896_000025_000001.wav|He alighted and went up the steps to the front door, but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart.

2277_149896_000002_000005.wav|He walked the floor of his little office, and later that of his room, putting one thing and another together to no avail.

2277_149896_000004_000000.wav|Hurstwood walked the floor, mentally arranging the chief points of his situation.

2277_149896_000011_000002.wav|He walked the floor again, pretending to be in an ordinary mood, but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words.
2277_149896_000016_000008.wav|He would go up there and have it out with her, that's what he would do.
2277_149896_000017_000000.wav|Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself.
2277_149896_000005_000005.wav|He would have to explain and deny and make a general mark of himself.
2277_149896_000018_000001.wav|I'll make her change her tone if I have to use force to do it!"
2277_149896_000030_000000.wav|So this was the game, was it?
2277_149896_000024_000003.wav|He would have no row.
2277_149896_000016_000009.wav|She was carrying things with too high a hand.
2277_149896_000009_000000.wav|His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, he waited and waited and Carrie did not come.
2277_149896_000005_000000.wav|He also thought of his managerial position.
2277_149896_000010_000000.wav|After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the Madison car. To add to his distress, the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun

2277_149896_000006_000001.wav|He saw no solution of anything-not a loophole left.
2277_149896_000016_000001.wav|The audacity of the thing took his breath.
2277_149896_000009_000003.wav|Could she have been reached by his wife?
2277_149896_000019_000002.wav|Pedestrians had turned up collars, and trousers at the bottom.
2277_149896_000028_000000.wav|"I saw a young girl up in that winder," returned the cabby.
2277_149896_000025_000003.wav|He shook at the knob, but the door was locked.
2277_149896_000005_000003.wav|My friends, too!" He grew more angry as he thought of the talk any action on her part would create.
2277_149896_000016_000004.wav|Then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing, contemplating the result of his work.
2277_149896_000008_000002.wav|He began to feel the appetite that had been wanting before he had reached the office, and decided before going out to the park to meet Carrie to drop in at the Grand Pacific and have a pot of coffee and some rolls.
2277_149896_000023_000001.wav|On the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case.
2277_149896_000019_000006.wav|He scarcely noticed the picture.
2277_149896_000016_000003.wav|His first impulse was to write but four words in reply-"Go to the devil!"--but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply.
2277_149896_000015_000005.wav|So don't delay, but send it by the boy."
2277_149896_000009_000002.wav|Could something have happened out there to keep her away?
2277_149896_000019_000000.wav|He arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street.
2277_149896_000019_000003.wav|Hands were hidden in the pockets of the umbrellaless; umbrellas were up.
2277_149896_000029_000000.wav|Hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now.
2277_149896_000015_000002.wav|You can stay away if you want to.
2277_149896_000030_000001.wav|Shut him out and make him pay.
2277_149896_000016_000006.wav|The confounded wretch!
2277_149896_000022_000000.wav|He put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella.
2277_149896_000026_000002.wav|He rang the bell and then waited.
2277_149896_000014_000001.wav|He tore it open and read without a show of feeling.
2277_149896_000004_000003.wav|Curse it!
2277_149896_000024_000001.wav|Perhaps he could do it up here.
2277_149897_000020_000000.wav|The boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings.
2277_149897_000030_000000.wav|There was no more to be done upon that score that night.
2277_149897_000012_000000.wav|"Yes, sir," said the boy.
2277_149897_000044_000001.wav|He did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away.
2277_149897_000037_000000.wav|He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shook his head.
2277_149897_000007_000001.wav|What could be the trouble in that quarter?
2277_149897_000015_000000.wav|"You've seen my wife?" he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy turned to go.
2277_149897_000006_000003.wav|He could hardly realise how it had all come about.
2277_149897_000045_000001.wav|This sent a pang through his heart.
2277_149897_000040_000008.wav|Come what might, he would adjust this matter, and soon.
2277_149897_000040_000005.wav|He had loved her earnestly enough, but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive.
2277_149897_000049_000000.wav|"Very truly yours, etc"
2277_149897_000006_000002.wav|How could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly?
2277_149897_000021_000001.wav|He tried to get the interest of things about him, but it was not to be.
2277_149897_000008_000001.wav|He was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar, but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him.
2277_149897_000039_000000.wav|Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket.
2277_149897_000040_000009.wav|He would go to her and tell her all his family complications. He would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her. Surely she couldn't go back on him now?
2277_149897_000008_000005.wav|He was altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation.
2277_149897_000035_000004.wav|It was the worst Sunday he had spent in his life.
2277_149897_000052_000000.wav|So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew what to expect.
2277_149897_000040_000003.wav|He thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon.
2277_149897_000009_000001.wav|It was with great opposition, after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial, that at last he got an envelope, placed in it the requested amount, and slowly sealed it up.
2277_149897_000016_000000.wav|"Oh, yes, sir.
2277_149897_000040_000006.wav|He really pined for a word, and looked out upon her with his mind's eye in the most wistful manner.
2277_149897_000013_000000.wav|"If she isn't there bring it back."
2277_149897_000004_000000.wav|CHAPTER twenty five
2277_149897_000043_000000.wav|Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing.
2277_149897_000045_000000.wav|One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almost opposite the building of the concern with which his son was connected.
2277_149897_000041_000000.wav|Suddenly he thought: "Supposing she isn't out there-suppose she has gone?"
2277_149897_000035_000000.wav|The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated.
2277_149897_000007_000000.wav|Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie.
2277_149897_000011_000000.wav|"You take this to this address," he said, handing him the envelope, "and give it to mrs Hurstwood."
2277_149897_000040_000001.wav|He was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy.
2277_149897_000020_000005.wav|He could see her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically.
2277_149897_000046_000000.wav|That night he dined at Rector's and returned at once to his office.
2277_149897_000030_000002.wav|He wondered what the morning would bring forth, and slept anything but soundly upon it.
2277_149897_000024_000000.wav|"I gave it to her."
2277_149897_000026_000000.wav|"Yes, sir."
2277_149897_000020_000008.wav|He breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face.
2277_149897_000020_000003.wav|He was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it.
2277_149897_000033_000001.wav|How about that now?
2277_149897_000007_000007.wav|It would be just like this to happen as things were going now. Meanwhile he had not sent the money.
2277_149897_000022_000000.wav|In about an hour and three quarters the boy returned.
2277_149897_000032_000000.wav|The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he had done it receded, his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more.
2277_149897_000047_000001.wav|It read:
2277_149897_000042_000001.wav|It was too much to think of and sit still.
2277_149897_000008_000000.wav|He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, his hands in his pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set.
2277_149897_000016_000001.wav|I know her."
2277_149897_000037_000001.wav|It seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning.
2277_149897_000007_000004.wav|He saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score.
2277_149897_000006_000004.wav|It seemed a monstrous, unnatural, unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance.
2277_149897_000035_000002.wav|Three o'clock came, four, five, six, and no letter.
2277_149897_000018_000000.wav|"Any answer?"
2277_149897_000032_000001.wav|He fancied, as he sat at his desk, that nothing would be done for a week or two.
2277_149897_000042_000000.wav|He was forced to take his feet.
2277_149897_000033_000003.wav|He decided to write her care of the West Side Post office and ask for an explanation, as well as to have her meet him.
2277_149897_000014_000000.wav|"Yes, sir."
2277_149897_000017_000000.wav|"All right, now.
2277_149897_000008_000002.wav|Every once in a while he would clinch his fingers and tap his foot-signs of the stirring mental process he was undergoing.
2277_149897_000007_000002.wav|No letter had come, no word of any kind, and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning.
2277_149897_000019_000000.wav|"I guess not."
2277_149897_000020_000006.wav|She would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed.
2277_149897_000007_000005.wav|He was desperately in love, and would have taken great chances to win her under ordinary circumstances, but now-now what? Supposing she had found out something?
2277_149897_000047_000000.wav|On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, james and Hay.
2277_149897_000017_000001.wav|Hurry right back."
2277_149897_000023_000000.wav|"Well?" said Hurstwood.
2277_149897_000032_000002.wav|Meanwhile, he would have time to think.
2277_149897_000046_000002.wav|He troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody.
2277_149897_000050_000000.wav|"Compromise!" exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly.
2277_149897_000052_000003.wav|He folded the letter and put it with the other one.
2277_149897_000005_000000.wav|ASHES OF TINDER: THE LOOSING OF STAYS
2277_149897_000044_000002.wav|He did not go within a block of the house.
2277_149897_000045_000004.wav|Well, well, fortune plays a man queer tricks.
2277_149897_000033_000004.wav|The thought that this letter would probably not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly.
2277_149897_000046_000003.wav|He stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked.
2277_149897_000020_000001.wav|Now he had done it.
2277_149897_000031_000002.wav|Nothing from his wife, which was pleasant.
2277_149897_000040_000004.wav|He was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion.
2277_149897_000020_000004.wav|But, oh, the wretchedness of being forced this way!
2277_149897_000031_000001.wav|No word from Carrie.
2277_149897_000040_000000.wav|To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie.
2277_149897_000040_000007.wav|He did not propose to lose her, whatever she might think.
2277_149897_000052_000001.wav|If he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly.
2277_149897_000025_000000.wav|"My wife?"
2277_149897_000009_000000.wav|For all his study nothing came of the evening except this-he sent the money.
2277_149897_000028_000000.wav|"She said it was high time."
2277_149897_000006_000000.wav|When Hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever.
2277_149897_000027_000000.wav|"Any answer?"
2277_149897_000033_000005.wav|He must get some speedier method-but how?
2277_149897_000008_000004.wav|He drank more brandy and soda than he had any evening in months.
2277_149897_000022_000001.wav|He had evidently delivered the package, for, as he came up, he made no sign of taking anything out of his pocket.
2277_149897_000020_000002.wav|There was no use speculating over that.
2277_149897_000040_000010.wav|It wasn't possible.
2277_149897_000040_000011.wav|He would plead until her anger would melt-until she would forgive him.
2277_149897_000045_000003.wav|His absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children.
2277_149897_000038_000000.wav|"Well!" he said after a time, quite audibly, "I don't know."
2277_149897_000045_000005.wav|He got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends.
2277_149897_000029_000000.wav|Hurstwood scowled fiercely.
2277_149897_000031_000000.wav|Next day he went again to the office and opened his mail, suspicious and hopeful of its contents.
2277_149897_000046_000001.wav|In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief.
2277_149897_000052_000002.wav|If he did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil.
2277_149897_000006_000001.wav|Lord, Lord, he thought, what had he got into?
2277_149874_000010_000000.wav|In the interval which marked the preparation of the meal Carrie found time to study the flat.
2277_149874_000012_000001.wav|Then she walked and sang to it, until Hanson, disturbed in his reading, came and took it.
2277_149874_000033_000003.wav|These vast buildings, what were they?
2277_149874_000026_000000.wav|"No," she said to herself, "he can't come here."
2277_149874_000018_000004.wav|It isn't very far."
2277_149874_000030_000006.wav|Anything was good enough so long as it paid-say, five dollars a week to begin with.
2277_149874_000015_000001.wav|He seemed to be thinking of something else.
2277_149874_000012_000002.wav|A pleasant side to his nature came out here. He was patient.
2277_149874_000025_000002.wav|She read from the manner of Hanson, in the subdued air of Minnie, and, indeed, the whole atmosphere of the flat, a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil.
2277_149874_000007_000005.wav|His one observation to the point was concerning the chances of work in Chicago.
2277_149874_000025_000001.wav|He could not come here.
2277_149874_000029_000000.wav|She troubled herself over what else to put in the letter.
2277_149874_000010_000001.wav|She had some slight gift of observation and that sense, so rich in every woman-intuition.
2277_149874_000030_000008.wav|She would get in one of the great shops and do well enough until-well, until something happened. Neither of them knew exactly what.
2277_149874_000034_000004.wav|What they dealt in, how they laboured, to what end it all came, she had only the vaguest conception.
2277_149874_000030_000007.wav|A shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer.
2277_149874_000007_000001.wav|Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper.
2277_149874_000004_000000.wav|CHAPTER two
2277_149874_000014_000001.wav|"Well, we'll go out Sunday and see Lincoln Park."
2277_149874_000008_000000.wav|"It's a big place," he said.
2277_149874_000028_000000.wav|"I cannot have you call on me here.
2277_149874_000030_000009.wav|They did not figure on promotion. They did not exactly count on marriage.
2277_149874_000020_000000.wav|"I've got to get up early in the morning, so I'll go to bed," and off he went, disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall, for the night.
2277_149874_000015_000000.wav|Carrie noticed that Hanson had said nothing to this.
2277_149874_000030_000005.wav|She was pleased to see her in a way, but reflected her husband's point of view in the matter of work.
2277_149874_000016_000000.wav|"Well," she said, "I think I'll look around to morrow.
2277_149874_000033_000004.wav|These strange energies and huge interests, for what purposes were they there?
2277_149874_000023_000000.wav|"At about twenty minutes of five."
2277_149874_000006_000001.wav|It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing.
2277_149874_000007_000002.wav|He was a silent man, American born, of a Swede father, and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stock yards.

2277_149874_000025_000003.wav|If Hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper, if he went to bed at nine, and Minnie a little later, what would they expect of her?
2277_149874_000018_000002.wav|"You'd better look in those big manufacturing houses along Franklin Street and just the other side of the river," he concluded. "Lots of girls work there.
2803_154328_000014_000000.wav|"I did not speak for ourselves," said Glenarvan.
2803_154328_000081_000001.wav|The misty summits began to pierce the morning mists.
2803_154328_000027_000000.wav|"Animal or man," answered the Major, "I will soon find out!"
2803_154328_000085_000001.wav|It came from the pah, whose direction Glenarvan did not know.
2803_154328_000040_000000.wav|"Watch the savages outside," said Robert.
2803_154328_000071_000000.wav|Glenarvan, holding with one hand to a tuft of tetragonia, with the other holding his wife, waited with breathless anxiety.
2803_154328_000030_000000.wav|The soil was light and friable, and below lay a bed of silicious tufa; therefore, even without tools, the aperture deepened quickly.
2803_154328_000018_000004.wav|All escape was thus hopeless, and Glenarvan having tried the walls for the twentieth time, was compelled to acknowledge that it was so.
2803_154328_000019_000000.wav|The hours of this night, wretched as they were, slipped away.
2803_154328_000019_000002.wav|Neither moon nor stars pierced the gloom.
2803_154328_000061_000000.wav|"This rope," said he, "will only bear the weight of two persons; therefore let us go in rotation.
2803_154328_000052_000000.wav|"No, Robert!" answered Mary Grant.
2803_154328_000062_000000.wav|"I will go first," said Robert.
2803_154328_000065_000000.wav|Glenarvan and Lady Helena immediately ventured out of the grotto.

2803_154328_000013_000000.wav|After these words were said, a profound silence ensued.
2803_154328_000058_000002.wav|john Mangles, before leaving the hut, disposed of all the evidences of their work, and in his turn slipped through the opening and let down over it the mats of the house, so that the entrance to the gallery was quite concealed.
2803_154328_000030_000001.wav|It soon became evident that a man, or men, clinging to the sides of the "pah," were cutting a passage into its exterior wall.
2803_154328_000006_000001.wav|Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud, her companions, bare headed, repeated it after her.
2803_154328_000039_000000.wav|"Brave lad!" repeated Glenarvan.
2803_154328_000055_000000.wav|"Well, lose no more time," said the Major.
2803_154328_000067_000001.wav|Then Glenarvan going first and supporting his wife, began to descend backward.
2803_154328_000047_000000.wav|"Let us be off!" said he, in a decided tone.
2803_154328_000059_000000.wav|The next thing was to descend the vertical wall to the slope below, and this would have been impracticable, but that Robert had brought the flax rope, which was now unrolled and fixed to a projecting point of rock, the end hanging over.
2803_154328_000033_000000.wav|john Mangles, inserting the blade of his poniard, avoided the knife which now protruded above the soil, but seized the hand that wielded it.
2803_154328_000004_000001.wav|Overcome as they were with horror and fatigue, they took their last meal together.
2803_154328_000055_000002.wav|Let us go."
2803_154328_000028_000000.wav|Wilson and Olbinett joined their companions, and all united to dig through the wall-john with his dagger, the others with stones taken from the ground, or with their nails, while Mulrady, stretched along the ground, watched the native guard through a crevice of the matting.
2803_154328_000032_000000.wav|Some minutes more passed, and the Major withdrew his hand from the stroke of a sharp blade.
2803_154328_000042_000001.wav|"There are only four awake; the rest are asleep."
2803_154328_000051_000000.wav|"No, my Lord; but is he not here?" inquired Robert.
2803_154328_000063_000000.wav|"Go, my boy," said Glenarvan, pressing Robert's hand.
2803_154328_000031_000000.wav|The prisoners redoubled their efforts.
2803_154328_000083_000002.wav|Paganel was not there to take the lead.
2803_154328_000068_000001.wav|Some birds, suddenly awakened, flew away, uttering feeble cries, and the fugitives trembled when a stone loosened from its bed rolled to the foot of the mountain.
2803_154328_000006_000005.wav|Sleep, which keeps all sorrow in abeyance, soon weighed down their eyelids; they slept in each other's arms, overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching.
2803_154328_000007_000004.wav|Stern as the decree may seem, I will not repine.
2803_154328_000015_000002.wav|But they all kept watchful guard on the hut confided to their care.
2803_154328_000080_000000.wav|They walked quickly, trying to avoid the points where they might be seen from the pah.
2803_154328_000034_000000.wav|It was the hand of a woman or child, a European!
2803_154328_000073_000003.wav|Then shaking his head like one who sees he is mistaken, he went back to his companions, took an armful of dead wood, and threw it into the smouldering fire, which immediately revived.
2803_154328_000016_000002.wav|The captive thinks oftener of escaping than the jailer of preventing his flight, and hence we hear of frequent and wonderful escapes.
2803_154328_000088_000000.wav|While they looked they were seen.
2803_154328_000085_000000.wav|Suddenly a terrific yell from a hundred throats rent the air.

2803_154328_000083_000006.wav|Dim outlines of hills and mountains rose behind one another; but Glenarvan only thought how best to get lost among them. Time enough by and by to see about escaping from the labyrinth.
2803_154328_000075_000000.wav|john signaled to Glenarvan to resume his descent.
2803_154328_000055_000001.wav|"Wherever Paganel is, he cannot be in worse plight than ourselves.
2803_154328_000023_000000.wav|The scratching became more and more audible; they could hear the little stones grate on a hard body and roll away.
2803_154328_000048_000000.wav|"Is Paganel below?" asked Glenarvan.
2803_154328_000014_000003.wav|Let us attack these wretches!' But with these poor girls-"
2803_154328_000081_000000.wav|Toward five o'clock, the day began to dawn, bluish clouds marbled the upper stratum of clouds.
2803_154328_000007_000000.wav|Then Glenarvan, taking his friends aside, said: "My dear friends, our lives and the lives of these poor women are in God's hands.
2803_154328_000037_000000.wav|"My darling Robert," said she, never doubting, "it is you! it is you!"
2803_154328_000058_000000.wav|The escape was commenced, and every precaution was taken.
2803_154328_000054_000000.wav|"No, my Lord!" said Robert, taken aback by the disappearance of his friend Paganel.
2803_154328_000083_000005.wav|Soon they had reached a height of five hundred feet above Lake Taupo, and the cold of the morning, increased by the altitude, was very keen.
2803_154328_000077_000000.wav|The rope was shaken three times, and in his turn john Mangles, preceding Mary Grant, followed in the dangerous route.
2803_154328_000073_000000.wav|One of the warriors on guard, startled by an unusual sound, rose and drew nearer to the Ware Atoua.
2803_154328_000007_000002.wav|God, who reads our hearts, knows that we had a noble end in view.
2803_154328_000045_000001.wav|I stole this knife and rope out of the desert hut.
2803_154328_000067_000000.wav|Glenarvan first, then Lady Helena, let themselves down along the rope, till they came to the spot where the perpendicular wall met the top of the slope.
2803_154328_000035_000000.wav|"Is it Robert?" whispered Glenarvan.
2803_154328_000083_000003.wav|He was now the object of their anxiety, and whose absence was a black shadow between them and their happiness.
2803_154328_000036_000000.wav|But softly as the name was breathed, Mary Grant, already awakened by the sounds in the hut, slipped over toward Glenarvan, and seizing the hand, all stained with earth, she covered it with kisses.
2803_154328_000062_000001.wav|"I discovered a deep hollow at the foot of the slope where those who come down can conceal themselves and wait for the rest."
2803_154328_000006_000002.wav|Who does not turn his thoughts toward God in the hour of death?
2803_154328_000015_000000.wav|At this moment john raised the mat, and counted twenty five natives keeping guard on the Ware Atoua.
2803_154328_000044_000000.wav|"My child, my child," murmured Lady Helena, "the savages did not kill you!"
2803_154328_000005_000001.wav|We must show these savages how Europeans can die."
2803_154328_000083_000000.wav|Another half an hour and the glorious sun would rise out of the mists of the horizon.
2803_154328_000008_000000.wav|Glenarvan's voice, firm till now, faltered.
2803_154328_000011_000000.wav|"Yes, john; but we are unarmed."
2803_154328_000022_000000.wav|"Listen," said he, motioning them to stoop.
2803_154328_000066_000001.wav|She felt stronger and commenced her perilous descent.
2803_154328_000010_000000.wav|"I believe," said john, "that in the sight of God I have a right to fulfill that promise."
2803_154328_000004_000000.wav|They had one night in which to prepare for death.
2803_154328_000069_000000.wav|They had reached half-way down the slope, when a voice was heard from the opening of the grotto.
2803_154328_000064_000000.wav|Robert disappeared through the opening out of the grotto.
2803_154328_000007_000001.wav|If it is decreed that we die to morrow, let us die bravely, like Christian men, ready to appear without terror before the Supreme Judge.
2803_154328_000060_000000.wav|john Mangles, before his friends trusted themselves to this flax rope, tried it; he did not think it very strong; and it was of importance not to risk themselves imprudently, as a fall would be fatal.
2803_154328_000006_000003.wav|This done, the prisoners embraced each other.
2803_154328_000080_000003.wav|Where chance led them, but at any rate they were free.
2803_154328_000056_000001.wav|They had to fly.
2803_154328_000014_000001.wav|"Be it as it may, we can face death!
2803_154328_000008_000001.wav|He was silent a moment, and having overcome his emotion, he said, addressing the young captain:
2803_154328_000086_000000.wav|But the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been discovered; and now the question was, would they be able to elude pursuit?
2803_154328_000007_000005.wav|But death here, means not death only, it means torture, insult, perhaps, and here are two ladies-"
2803_154328_000013_000002.wav|I am not an advocate of irremediable measures."
2803_154328_000038_000000.wav|"Yes, little sister," said he, "it is I am here to save you all; but be very silent."
2803_154328_000053_000002.wav|Did you not get away together?"
2803_154328_000009_000000.wav|"john, you have promised Mary what I promised Lady Helena.
2803_154328_000016_000001.wav|The jailer may forget that he is on guard; the prisoner never forgets that he is guarded.
2803_154328_000019_000001.wav|Thick darkness had settled on the mountain.
2803_154328_000086_000001.wav|Had they been seen?
2803_154328_000012_000002.wav|My Lord, whichever of us survives the other will fulfill the wish of Lady Helena and Mary Grant."
2803_154328_000043_000001.wav|Round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope.
2803_154328_000085_000002.wav|Besides, a thick veil of fog, which, spread at his feet, prevented any distinct view of the valleys below.
2803_154328_000084_000000.wav|At last the sun appeared and sent his first rays on their path.
2803_154328_000006_000000.wav|The meal ended.
2803_154328_000025_000000.wav|Glenarvan struck his forehead.
2803_154328_000034_000002.wav|It was evidently the cue of both sides to be silent.
2803_154320_000001_000003.wav|The heavy, lumpy sea strained her cordage, her timbers creaked, and she labored painfully in the trough of the sea.
2803_154320_000021_000006.wav|And if your Lordship is bent on looking out for her, let it be in order to give her a wide berth."
2803_154320_000018_000001.wav|"john, my heart is broken; and sometimes despair nearly masters me.
2803_154320_000007_000000.wav|"And yet," said the young captain, "you must be longing to quit this vessel.
2803_154320_000012_000000.wav|"My yacht! the DUNCAN," said Glenarvan, hotly.
2803_154320_000020_000000.wav|"Not for myself, john, but for those I love-whom you love, also."
2803_154320_000003_000001.wav|They often braved the weather, and went on the poop till driven down again by the force of a sudden squall.
2803_154320_000021_000003.wav|Will Halley is a brute, but I am keeping my eyes open, and if the coast looks dangerous, I will put the ship's head to sea again. So that, on that score, there is little or no danger.
2803_154320_000004_000003.wav|Much as they had been interested in his dissertation on the Pampas, or Australia, his lectures on New Zealand fell on cold and indifferent ears.
2803_154320_000009_000001.wav|"Look more to starboard."
2803_154320_000004_000002.wav|Their minds were so distracted at this change of route as to be quite unhinged.
2803_154320_000007_000001.wav|We ought to have seen the lights of Auckland thirty six hours ago."
2803_154320_000004_000004.wav|Besides, they were going to this new and ill reputed country without enthusiasm, without conviction, not even of their own free will, but solely at the bidding of destiny.
2803_154320_000017_000002.wav|Our lives would be worth little.
2803_154320_000015_000000.wav|"Your Lordship forgets our position.
2803_154320_000014_000000.wav|"Why, john?"
2803_154320_000022_000002.wav|There was every reason to fear such an engagement in these narrow seas, in which pirates could ply their trade without risk.
2803_154320_000003_000002.wav|Then they returned to the narrow space, fitter for stowing cargo than accommodating passengers, especially ladies.
2803_154320_000011_000000.wav|"What then, my Lord?"
2803_154320_000012_000001.wav|"It must be here on these coasts, skimming these very waves, playing the vile part of a pirate! It is here, john; I am certain of it, on the track of vessels between Australia and New Zealand; and I have a presentiment that we shall fall in with her."
2803_154320_000018_000000.wav|"Poor girls!" murmured Glenarvan.
2803_154320_000021_000000.wav|"Keep up your heart, my Lord," said the young captain.
2803_154320_000022_000003.wav|However, for that day at least, the yacht did not appear, and the sixth night from their departure from Twofold Bay came, without the fears of john Mangles being realized.
2803_154320_000019_000000.wav|"You, my Lord?"
2803_154320_000005_000002.wav|He could not stay in one place.
2803_154320_000017_000000.wav|"Yes, my Lord; we should try in vain!
2803_154320_000021_000001.wav|"We must not look out for troubles.
2803_154320_000008_000001.wav|He still looked, and for a moment his glass was pointed toward the horizon to windward.
2803_154320_000001_000002.wav|The wind was fair, nevertheless, and blew steadily from the southwest; but the currents were against the ship's course, and she scarcely made any way.
2803_154320_000006_000000.wav|Glenarvan shook his head in dissent.
2803_154320_000001_000000.wav|STILL this wearisome voyage dragged on.
2803_154320_000010_000000.wav|"Why, john?" replied Glenarvan.
2803_154320_000017_000004.wav|Think of Lady Glenarvan; think of Mary Grant!"
2803_154320_000017_000003.wav|We would fight to the death, of course, but after that!
2803_154320_000017_000001.wav|We should be taken, delivered up to the mercy of those wretches, and Ben Joyce has shown us that he does not stop at a crime!
2803_154320_000021_000004.wav|But as to getting alongside the DUNCAN!
2803_154320_000021_000005.wav|God forbid!

2803_154320_000013_000000.wav|"God keep us from such a meeting!"
2803_154320_000005_000012.wav|john came up to him and said, "Your Lordship is looking out for land?"

2803_161169_000013_000002.wav|As it floated on the surface of the water (for oil and water will not mix, you know), the boys, for mischief, set fire to it, and a stream of fire rolled along down the river; proving to everybody who saw it, that a new light, as good as gas, had come from the coal.
2803_161169_000010_000001.wav|Let us look at them; for perhaps we can examine them more closely than we can the roof, and the sides of these halls.
2803_161169_000010_000003.wav|How did it happen, and what does it mean?
2803_161169_000005_000000.wav|At first, you know, they will only play.

2803_161169_000005_000008.wav|The least they could do would be to try to use every thing for the purposes intended, and not to destroy or injure any of the precious gifts prepared so lovingly for their use.

2803_161169_000009_000002.wav|Look a little closer, while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at your side.
2803_161169_000008_000003.wav|We shall need a guide; and here comes one,--a rough looking man, with smutty clothes, and an odd little lamp covered with wire gauze, fastened to the front of his cap.
2803_161169_000010_000000.wav|Did you notice the great pillars of coal that are left to uphold the roof?
2803_161169_000010_000002.wav|Here are mosses and little leaves, and sometimes an odd looking little body that is not unlike some of the sea creatures we found at the beach last summer; and every thing is made of coal, nothing but coal.

2803_161169_000011_000005.wav|These forests were of trees, different in some ways from those we have now, great ferns as tall as this house, and mosses as high as little trees, and palm leaves of enormous size.
2803_161169_000011_000013.wav|The thought came to them that it might be prepared from coal, and conducted through pipes to our houses to take the place of lamps or candles, which until that time had been the only light.
2803_161169_000015_000001.wav|I have only told you enough to teach you how to look for yourselves; a peep, you know, is all I promised you.
2803_161169_000008_000005.wav|But you will find that they are really pulled and pushed by an engine that stands outside the doorway and reaches them by long chains.
2803_161169_000005_000004.wav|And so through many questions, and many experiments, they learn at last how to use the contents of this one storehouse.
2803_161169_000011_000002.wav|What should we have done, if everybody had kept on burning wood to this day?
2803_161169_000008_000007.wav|So this great green hill, upon which you might run or play, is inside like what I think some of those large anthills must be,--traversed by galleries, and full of rooms and long passages.
2803_161169_000004_000000.wav|Once there was a father who thought he would build for his children a beautiful home, putting into it every thing they could need or desire throughout their lives.
2803_161169_000008_000008.wav|All about we see men like our guide, working by the light of their little lamps.
2803_161169_000014_000001.wav|If she does, you are indebted again to the coal oil, for of that it is partly made.
2803_161169_000009_000005.wav|Here is something different, rounded like a nut shell; you can split off one side, and behold there is the nut lying snugly as does any chestnut in its bur!
6345_93302_000036_000005.wav|Her hands should have been full of bluebells, and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms.
6345_93302_000052_000001.wav|What had he done-a murder-a bank robbery-married someone else?
6345_93302_000036_000004.wav|She herself should have been a poem-a lyric in a white gown and green scarf, coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs.
6345_93302_000075_000009.wav|He loved her with all his heart, and he, also, had what she had never suspected in him-the literary sense.
6345_93302_000075_000000.wav|He stood up suddenly.
6345_93302_000057_000003.wav|What was it, compared with her fears?
6345_93302_000046_000010.wav|Yet she must speak.
6345_93302_000058_000001.wav|These inspired her.
6345_93302_000062_000003.wav|No-it's no use-I can never, never forgive you-and it's all over.
6345_93302_000061_000000.wav|Those four true words wounded her more than all the rest.
6345_93302_000046_000001.wav|Some great sorrow had come to him.
6345_93302_000054_000003.wav|I haven't answered her letter."
6345_93302_000065_000002.wav|"You've deceived me once-you'd do it again!
6345_93302_000057_000011.wav|How could she guess that he had tuned his confession to the key of what he believed would be an innocent girl's estimate of his misconduct?
6345_93302_000075_000001.wav|"Then good bye," he said, "and may God forgive you as I do!" And he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door.
6345_93302_000042_000004.wav|But here-the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at.
6345_93302_000075_000006.wav|He checked the silly impulse.
6345_93302_000036_000006.wav|You see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals.
6345_93302_000057_000009.wav|As the confession of a crime she must receive it.
6345_93302_000070_000001.wav|"Do you mean it?" he said, and his tone should have warned her.
6345_93302_000057_000008.wav|He had told her of the thing as one tells of a crime.
6345_93302_000041_000000.wav|They did not speak again till they had gone through the little back streets, past the police station and the mustard factory, and were on the broad pavement of Queen Victoria Street.
6345_93302_000039_000001.wav|He ought to insist on the railway carriage: he probably would.
6345_93302_000036_000002.wav|She would have liked to meet him in some green, cool orchard, where daffodils swung in the long grass, and primroses stood on frail stiff little pink stalks in the wet, scented moss of the hedgerow.
6345_93302_000049_000003.wav|I can't bear to see you looking so miserable," and there was another silence.
6345_93302_000037_000008.wav|She had grown anxious, as the one who waits always does, and she was extremely glad to see him, but she knew that a late lover should be treated with a provoking coldness (one can relent prettily later on), so she gave him a limp hand and no greeting.
6345_93302_000064_000000.wav|"Forgive me, dear," he said.
6345_93302_000062_000001.wav|Then how can I ever trust you?
6345_93302_000066_000000.wav|"Do you think I'm not sorry now?"
6345_93302_000059_000001.wav|"You don't love me-you've never loved me-I was an idiot to believe you did."
6345_93302_000065_000001.wav|"Never," she said, her eyes flashing through her tears.
6345_93302_000044_000000.wav|"I'm freezing," she said suddenly; "let's go and have some tea."
6345_93302_000062_000002.wav|Even if we were married I could never be sure you weren't kissing some horrid girl or other.
6345_93302_000057_000000.wav|She drew a deep breath.
6345_93302_000039_000000.wav|It was bitterly cold, but the Embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage.
6345_93302_000000_000000.wav|This is a LibriVox recording.
6345_93302_000037_000006.wav|He would hardly have known her in green and white muslin and an orchard, for their love had been born and bred in town-Highbury New Park, to be exact.
6345_93302_000042_000000.wav|He had been late: he had offered no excuse, no explanation.
6345_93302_000054_000002.wav|Oh, Ethel, do try to forgive me!
6345_93302_000069_000004.wav|"Go home and gloat over it all!
6345_93302_000045_000000.wav|"Of course, if you like," he said uncomfortably; yet she could see he was glad that she had broken that desolate silence.
6345_93302_000069_000006.wav|This really was a master stroke of nobility.
6345_93302_000037_000001.wav|And, curiously enough, she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say.
6345_93302_000046_000006.wav|Well, it was not too late.
6345_93302_000069_000002.wav|There's no more to be said; you've betrayed me.
6345_93302_000042_000003.wav|Then he would have had to say something.
6345_93302_000070_000002.wav|"Are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this?"
6345_93302_000072_000001.wav|I'm only talking as I know good girls ought to talk"?
6345_93302_000046_000011.wav|When she did her words did not fit the mouth of the girl in the orchard-but then it would have been May there, and this was January.
6345_93302_000036_000001.wav|And the fact that she was to meet him at Cannon Street Station would almost, she feared, make the meeting itself banal, sordid.
6345_93302_000049_000000.wav|The fine tact of a noble woman seemed to have deserted her.
6345_93302_000057_000007.wav|He himself was evidently a prey to the most rending remorse.
6345_93302_000070_000000.wav|He stood up suddenly.
6345_93302_000055_000000.wav|"Well?" she said.
6345_93302_000046_000003.wav|The girl in the orchard would have known at a glance.
6345_93302_000069_000003.wav|I didn't think a decent man could do such things." She was pulling on her gloves.
6345_93302_000037_000000.wav|He had asked her to meet him at Cannon Street; he had something to say to her, and at home it was difficult to get a quiet half hour because of her little sisters.
6345_93302_000043_000000.wav|Why on earth didn't he speak?
6345_93302_000074_000000.wav|"Yes.
6345_93302_000053_000000.wav|It was on the tip of her tongue to say that she would stand by him whatever he had done; but if he had married someone else this would be improper, so she only said, "Well?" and she said it coldly.
6345_93302_000040_000000.wav|"Oh, the Embankment, please!" and felt a sting of annoyance and disappointment when he acquiesced.
6345_93302_000057_000004.wav|She almost said, "Never mind, dear.
6345_93302_000042_000001.wav|She had done the proper thing; she had awaited these with dignified reserve, and now she was involved in the meshes of a silence that she could not break. How easy it would have been in the orchard!
6345_93302_000037_000007.wav|He came towards her; he was five minutes late.
6345_93302_000075_000011.wav|Because Destiny is almost without the literary sense, and Destiny carelessly decreed that he should die of enteric in a wretched hut, without so much as hearing a gun fired.
6345_93302_000046_000008.wav|But how?
6345_93302_000063_000001.wav|Her tears were falling hot and fast between face and veil, for she had talked till she was very sorry indeed for herself.
6345_93302_000038_000000.wav|"Let's go out," he said.
6345_93302_000036_000007.wav|She had, to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment, the literary sense.

6345_93302_000043_000002.wav|She stole a glance at him, and for the first time it occurred to her that his "something to say" was not a mere excuse for being alone with her. He had something to say-something that was trying to get itself said. The keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket. Her hands and feet were aching with cold.
6345_93302_000037_000002.wav|She only wished for May and the orchard, instead of January and the dingy, dusty waiting room, the plain faced, preoccupied travellers, the dim, desolate weather.

6345_93302_000065_000003.wav|No, it's all over-you've broken my heart and destroyed my faith in human nature. I hope I shall never see you again.
6345_93302_000043_000003.wav|How warm it would have been in the orchard!
6345_93302_000050_000000.wav|The waitress brought the two thick cups of tea, and looked at him with a tepid curiosity.
6345_93302_000068_000000.wav|He would come to morrow, however, and then- At present the thing to compass was a dignified parting.
6345_93302_000057_000006.wav|What opinion would he form of the purity of her mind, the innocence of her soul, if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply?
6345_93302_000074_000001.wav|Good bye!"
6345_93302_000036_000000.wav|SHE was going to meet her lover.
6345_93302_000050_000001.wav|As soon as the two were alone again he leaned his elbows on the marble and spoke.
6345_93302_000058_000000.wav|Following the tingle of relief came a sharp, sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification.
6345_93302_000042_000002.wav|She could have snapped off a blossoming branch and-and made play with it somehow.
6345_93302_000048_000000.wav|"Yes, isn't it?" he said.
6345_93302_000075_000013.wav|Yet perhaps, after all, that is not because of the literary sense. It may be because she loved him.
6345_93302_000069_000001.wav|And it's good bye for ever. No-it's only painful for both of us.
6345_93302_000060_000000.wav|"You know I do," he said; "it was hateful of me-but I couldn't help it."
6345_93302_000062_000000.wav|"Couldn't help it?
6345_93302_000067_000001.wav|At home she could at least have buried her face in the sofa cushions and resisted all his pleading,--at last, perhaps, letting him take one cold passive hand and shower frantic kisses upon it.
6345_93302_000063_000000.wav|He could not say, "And so I am, on the whole," which was what he thought.
6345_93302_000075_000005.wav|But how could he go back to say, "We are parting for ever; but still, I must insist on the sad pleasure of paying for our tea-for the last time"?
6345_93302_000046_000007.wav|She could begin now.
6345_93302_000047_000000.wav|"How frightfully cold it is!"
6345_93302_000075_000003.wav|At the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea, and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error.
6345_93302_000042_000005.wav|And how common and mean that would be compared with the blossoming bough; and besides, the shops they were passing had nothing in the windows except cheap pastry and models of steam engines.
6345_93302_000043_000001.wav|He had never been like this before.
6345_93302_000039_000002.wav|So she said-
6345_93302_000073_000000.wav|So she said-
6345_93302_000075_000008.wav|So she waited for him in vain, and at last paid for the tea herself, and went home to wait there-and there, too, in vain, for he never came back to her.
6345_93302_000036_000003.wav|The time should have been May.
6345_93302_000075_000002.wav|It was a very good exit.
6345_93302_000071_000000.wav|The anger in his eyes frightened her, and the misery of his face wrung her heart; but how could she say-
6345_93302_000038_000001.wav|"Shall we walk along the Embankment, or go somewhere on the Underground?"
6345_93302_000046_000002.wav|And she had been sulking!
6345_93302_000069_000000.wav|"Good bye," she said; "I'm going home.
6345_93302_000065_000000.wav|Then she rose to the occasion.
6345_93302_000046_000000.wav|Seated at a marble table-the place was nearly empty-she furtively watched his face in the glass, and what she saw there thrilled her.
6345_93302_000052_000000.wav|This preamble sent a shiver of dread down her spine.
6345_93302_000046_000005.wav|She would have shared his sorrow, and shown herself "half wife, half angel from heaven" in this dark hour.
6345_93302_000037_000004.wav|Her dress was brown, her jacket black, and her hat was home trimmed.
6345_93302_000051_000000.wav|"Look here, darling, I've got something to tell you, and I hope to God you'll forgive me and stand by me, and try to understand that I love you just the same, and whatever happens I shall always love you."
6345_93302_000037_000003.wav|The setting of the scene seemed to her all important.
6345_93302_000057_000010.wav|How should she know that he had only told her because he feared that she would anyhow hear it through the indiscretion of the girl in pink, or of that other girl in blue who had seen and smiled?
6345_93306_000037_000000.wav|She stopped short, and looked at him through the dusk.
6345_93306_000038_000000.wav|"Go on," he said, "tell me all about it."
6345_93306_000018_000000.wav|Again that strange hesitation-then quite suddenly the girl put her hands up to her face and began to cry.
6345_93306_000009_000002.wav|She wore the dress of a Contadina, a very smart dress indeed, and her hands looked small and white.
6345_93306_000054_000001.wav|I told you so!" said his mother at once-and the young man sat down at his study table and looked at the title of his article on "The Decadence of Criticism." It was surely a very long time ago that he had written that.
6345_93306_000022_000000.wav|She looked at him and spoke for the first time.
6345_93306_000017_000000.wav|"I have brought you some wine-will you have it?"
6345_93306_000019_000006.wav|Oh, Lord!"
6345_93306_000054_000002.wav|And he sat there thinking, till his mother's voice roused him.
6345_93306_000028_000001.wav|Her eyes filled again with tears.
6345_93306_000019_000004.wav|Here, signorina, ecco, prendi-vino-gatto-No, gatto's a cat.
6345_93306_000010_000000.wav|"Won't you sing again?" he asked.
6345_93306_000014_000000.wav|"Aren't you tired?" he said.
6345_93306_000014_000001.wav|"Wouldn't you like to sit down and rest? There is a seat in the garden at the side of the house."
6345_93306_000050_000000.wav|"So it's your destiny to marry a duke, is it?" the young man spoke slowly.
6345_93306_000036_000000.wav|"I'm coming to that," she said.
6345_93306_000015_000001.wav|Then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes.
6345_93306_000030_000001.wav|Why, that's nothing.
6345_93306_000004_000001.wav|There had been five organs since dinner-and seven in the afternoon-one and all urgently thumping their heavy melodies into his brain, to the confusion of the thoughts that waited there, eager to marshal themselves, orderly and firm, into the phalanx of an article on "The Decadence of Criticism."
6345_93306_000005_000000.wav|He filled his pipe, drew paper towards him, dipped his pen, and wrote his title on the blank page.
6345_93306_000008_000005.wav|He threw back the curtain and leaned out of the window.
6345_93306_000036_000003.wav|The hotel folks let her go-I can't think how people can be so silly.
6345_93306_000042_000001.wav|I will catch the night train, and bring my mother up to morrow.
6345_93306_000044_000000.wav|"But don't you know anyone in London?" he asked in a sensible postscript.
6345_93306_000013_000000.wav|Never had any act seemed so impossible.
6345_93306_000035_000000.wav|Her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently.
6345_93306_000015_000000.wav|Again she hesitated.
6345_93306_000023_000005.wav|I am sure you meant to be kind." And then she began to cry again.
6345_93306_000004_000000.wav|The young man drew a deep breath of relief, and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table, for now the late summer dusk was falling, and that organ, please Heaven, made full the measure of the day's appointed torture.
6345_93306_000019_000005.wav|I was thinking of French.
6345_93306_000056_000000.wav|She held out a pair of little patent leather shoes, very worn and dusty-the slender silken web of a black stocking, brown with dust, hung from her hand.
6345_93306_000009_000000.wav|"Here!" he called to the figure that moved slowly towards the gate.
6345_93306_000039_000005.wav|I feel as if I had been beaten."
6345_93306_000057_000004.wav|It was plain that his castanet girl-his mother and sister took a pleasure in crediting her daily with some fresh and unpleasing instrument-could have had neither taste, money, nor honesty to such a point as this.
6345_93306_000049_000000.wav|"It wasn't I who said that," said the girl, smiling; "but that's so, anyhow." And then she sighed.
6345_93306_000041_000000.wav|He reflected a moment.
6345_93306_000025_000000.wav|She drank obediently.
6345_93306_000024_000004.wav|Perhaps I can help you."
6345_93306_000023_000004.wav|Let me go-thank you very much.
6345_93306_000046_000003.wav|You see, papa's so very rich, and at home they expect me to-to get acquainted with dukes and things-and-"
6345_93306_000024_000003.wav|Do drink this, and then tell me.
6345_93306_000048_000000.wav|"American heiresses are expected to marry English dukes," he said, with a distinct physical pain at his heart.
6345_93306_000056_000002.wav|She spent the rest of that day in searching the house for further losses, but all things were in their place, except the silver handled button hook-and that, as even his sister owned, had been missing for months.
6345_93306_000042_000000.wav|"I shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house-and then I shall give you my latch key, and you can let yourself in and stay the night here-there is no one in the house.
6345_93306_000057_000002.wav|The half dozen pairs of embroidered silk stockings and the dainty French silver buckled shoes, which arrived a month later addressed to Miss ----, Hill View Villa, only confirmed their distrust.
6345_93306_000006_000001.wav|He sprang to his feet-this was, indeed, too much!
6345_93306_000023_000000.wav|"It serves me right," she said in excellent, yet unfamiliar, English.
6345_93306_000050_000001.wav|"All the same," he added irrelevantly, "you shall have the latch key."
6345_93306_000005_000002.wav|After all, it was a "quiet neighbourhood" as the advertisement had said-at any rate, in the evening: and in the evening a man's best efforts-
6345_93306_000011_000000.wav|She hesitated, then struck a chord or two and began another of those little tuneful Italian songs, all stars and flowers and hearts of gold. And again he listened with a quiet pleasure.
6345_93306_000043_000000.wav|The only excuse for this rash young man is to be found in the fact that while he was feeding his strange guest with cake and wine she was feeding, with her beauty, the first fire of his first love.
6345_93306_000032_000001.wav|You've quarrelled with your friends, and-Ah, tell me-and let me try to help you."
6345_93306_000054_000000.wav|"An adventuress!
6345_93306_000026_000001.wav|He had no time to think, but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him.
6345_93306_000023_000001.wav|"I don't understand a single word you say!
6345_93306_000036_000001.wav|"Of course he didn't.
6345_93306_000042_000002.wav|Then we will see what can be done."
6345_93306_000039_000003.wav|And I've been at it since five o'clock-and I've only got one shilling and seven pence.
6345_93306_000043_000001.wav|Love at first sight is all nonsense, we know-we who have come to forty year-but at twenty one one does not somehow recognise it for the nonsense it is.
6345_93306_000026_000000.wav|He hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her.
6345_93306_000030_000002.wav|I'm poor, too."
6345_93306_000024_000000.wav|"Look here," he said, "this is all nonsense, you know.
6345_93306_000051_000002.wav|Then it was taken away.
6345_93306_000051_000001.wav|He did not kiss it then, only took it in his, and felt how small and cold it was.
6345_93306_000031_000000.wav|She laughed.
6345_93306_000020_000001.wav|She rose.
6345_93306_000016_000001.wav|He went into the dining room, dark with mahogany and damask, found wine and cake in the sideboard cupboard, put them on a tray, and took them out through the garden door and round to the corner where, almost sheltered by laburnums and hawthorns from the view of the people next door, the singer and her guitar rested on the iron seat.
6345_93306_000009_000001.wav|She turned quickly, and came back two steps.
6345_93306_000008_000002.wav|He stood with his hand on the curtain, listening-and with a pleasure that astonished him.
6345_93306_000008_000001.wav|The performer was evidently singing "under her voice," but the effect was charming.
6345_93306_000039_000000.wav|"Well, then, I went into lodgings; that wicked woman had left me one street suit-and to day they turned me out because my money was all gone.
6345_93306_000003_000000.wav|THE last strains of the ill treated, ill fated "Intermezzo" had died away, and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrel organ that had so gaily executed that, along with the nine other tunes of its repertory, to the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite, and the crowing delight of the two babies next door.
6345_93306_000056_000001.wav|He answered nothing.
6345_93306_000023_000003.wav|It would have turned out all right with them.
6345_93306_000008_000000.wav|and so forth.
6345_93306_000023_000002.wav|I might have known I couldn't do it, though it's just what girls in books would do.
6345_93306_000008_000004.wav|Then there was silence-then a sigh, and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel.
6345_93306_000019_000000.wav|"Here-I say, you know-don't-" he said.
6345_93306_000040_000000.wav|"Let me think," he said.
6345_93306_000029_000000.wav|"You don't know how horrid everyone has been.
6345_93306_000024_000002.wav|What is it?
6345_64257_000016_000002.wav|And the voice said, "Poor child! something has closed the valve between her heart and mine." With that came a pang of intense pain.
6345_64257_000004_000006.wav|If for a moment a thing looked the same as before, she wondered vaguely, unconsciously, how it could be.
6345_64257_000004_000000.wav|That night was the first herald of the coming winter, and blew a cold blast from his horn.
6345_64257_000014_000002.wav|But she neither loved the light nor mourned the shadow.
6345_64257_000005_000002.wav|The loss, the evanishment, the ceasing, were incontrovertible-the only incontrovertible things: she was sure of them: could she be sure of anything else?
6345_64257_000005_000005.wav|At last she fell asleep, and in a moment was dreaming diligently.
6345_64257_000010_000002.wav|"She is nothing to me.
6345_64257_000014_000001.wav|She was like a fish in a sea of light.
6345_64257_000010_000003.wav|If I speak to her, she is not there.
6345_64257_000009_000003.wav|He came to her side, and she gave him no greeting.
6345_64257_000007_000000.wav|She found herself at length in an avenue of dark trees, the end of which was far off.
6345_64257_000007_000009.wav|She was out of place, and much unwelcome.
6345_64257_000009_000009.wav|I am nothing.
6345_64257_000009_000016.wav|Her whole consciousness was merest, all but abstract, loss.
6345_64257_000001_000000.wav|CHAPTER twelve.
6345_64257_000012_000000.wav|But the dead, one of them seized one of her hands, and another the other.
6345_64257_000008_000008.wav|It was all deadness.
6345_64257_000005_000001.wav|Death was a fact.
6345_64257_000004_000001.wav|All day the wind had been out.
6345_64257_000012_000002.wav|Thus was she borne away captive of her dead, neither willing nor unwilling, of life and death equally careless.
6345_64257_000006_000000.wav|She was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before-a beautiful house with a large garden behind.
6345_64257_000004_000004.wav|The smell of the linen, of the blue cloth, and of the brown paper-things no longer to be handled by those tender, faithful hands-was dismal and strange, and haunted her like things that intruded, things which she had done with, and which yet would not go away.
6345_64257_000010_000000.wav|Then came the form of her mother, and bent over that of her brother from behind.
6345_64257_000009_000002.wav|But not a throb went through her heart.
6345_64257_000009_000015.wav|Her only life was, that she was lost.
6345_64257_000009_000014.wav|The old time was but a thicker dream, and this is truer because more shadowy." And, the form still standing by her, she felt it was ages away; she was divided from it by a gulf of very nothingness.
6345_64257_000008_000001.wav|No carriage rolled along the center, no footfarer walked on the side.
6345_64257_000003_000000.wav|That night, and every night until the dust was laid to the dust, Mary slept well; and through the days she had great composure; but, when the funeral was over, came a collapse and a change.
6345_64257_000007_000002.wav|At the end of it she was in a place of tombs.
6345_64257_000006_000004.wav|Every now and then she came on a little group, or met a party of the guests, as she walked, but none spoke to her, or seemed to see her, and she spoke to none.
6345_64257_000010_000005.wav|Oh, cold creatures, ye are not what ye seem, and I will none of you!"
6345_64257_000009_000012.wav|I know it, and there is no waking.
6345_64257_000009_000005.wav|"He is dead.
6345_64257_000014_000000.wav|Of a sudden a great splendor burst upon her, and through her eyelids she was struck blind-blind with light and not with darkness, for all was radiance about her.
6345_64257_000011_000004.wav|The universe was sunk in one of the dreams that haunt the sleep of death; and, if these were ghosts at all, they were ghosts walking in their sleep.
6345_64257_000012_000003.wav|Through the moonlight they led her from the city, and over fields, and through valleys, and across rivers and seas-a long journey; nor did she grow weary, for there was not life enough in her to be made weary.
6345_64257_000008_000004.wav|She knew nothing of the place, had nowhere to go, nowhere she wanted to go, had not a thought to tell her what question to ask, if she met a living soul.
6345_64257_000007_000003.wav|Terror and a dismay indescribable seized her; she turned and fled back to the company of her kind.
6345_64257_000011_000002.wav|Even if he were alive, her heart was past being moved.
6345_64257_000009_000008.wav|It is nothing.
6345_64257_000009_000011.wav|Everything is an empty dream of loss.
6345_64257_000005_000003.wav|How could she? She had not seen Christ rise; she had never looked upon one of the dead; never heard a voice from the other bank; had received no certain testimony.
6345_64257_000007_000004.wav|But for a long time she sought the house in vain; she could not reach it; the avenue seemed interminable to her feet returning.
6345_64257_000012_000004.wav|The dead never spoke to her, and she never spoke to them.
1988_24833_000052_000000.wav|"I told Tom we shouldn't come so late," says Hilda.
1988_24833_000060_000005.wav|I've decided to enlist in the Army."
1988_24833_000060_000001.wav|The job isn't getting me anywhere I want to go.
1988_24833_000020_000000.wav|"So-he cares."
1988_24833_000009_000004.wav|Right away when I bring home my new program, he says, "How come you're taking one less course this half?"
1988_24833_000046_000001.wav|It's a quarter to eleven.
1988_24833_000025_000000.wav|mr Palumbo comes back to the shop then, and Tom gets busy with the plants.
1988_24833_000064_000001.wav|"The recruiting officer, as a matter of fact, tried to persuade me to shoot for officers' training and go into the Army as a career.
1988_24833_000009_000002.wav|The second semester I switch to a music course.
1988_24833_000044_000000.wav|"Well, I don't think you should turn a guy's t v program off in the middle without even finding out about it."
1988_24833_000019_000001.wav|He just likes to boss everything I do."
1988_24833_000054_000000.wav|Hilda sits on the sofa, where Cat is curled up.
1988_24833_000047_000000.wav|Pop moves out of the doorway.
1988_24833_000004_000001.wav|Somehow or other Cat has taught them that he's in charge here, and he just chases them for fun now and again, when he's not busy sleeping.
1988_24833_000011_000000.wav|"Music!" he snorts.
1988_24833_000022_000000.wav|"Besides," says Tom, "half the reason you and your father are always bickering is that you're so much alike."
1988_24833_000045_000000.wav|Pop says "Hmm" this time, and we both stand and simmer down.
1988_24833_000068_000002.wav|Tom wouldn't even be standing here if it wasn't for Cat."
1988_24833_000033_000001.wav|"Pop, that's not fair!
1988_24833_000036_000003.wav|Go get a sponge to mop up the soda."
1988_24833_000014_000000.wav|"Loaf!" I yelp.
1988_24833_000035_000003.wav|It's not a western."
1988_24833_000050_000001.wav|It's Tom, and Hilda is with him.
1988_24833_000065_000001.wav|"Well, shove back the coffee cups, and I'll break out that bottle of champagne that's been sitting in the icebox since Christmas."
1988_24833_000060_000004.wav|You know, I'd get drafted in a year or two, anyway.
1988_24833_000066_000000.wav|I go and retrieve my spilled bottle of soda.
1988_24833_000054_000001.wav|He looks at her, puts his head back and goes on sleeping.
1988_24833_000011_000002.wav|Do it on your own time!"
1988_24833_000062_000000.wav|"No, not if I enlist in the Army.
1988_24833_000005_000002.wav|She sneaks the kittens saucers of cream and bits of real hamburger when no one's looking, and she likes talking to them in the kitchen.
1988_24833_000012_000001.wav|You think the school signs me up for an hour of home record playing?"
1988_24833_000005_000001.wav|For one thing, Mom really likes them.
1988_24833_000050_000000.wav|Pop goes to the door.
1988_24833_000011_000001.wav|"That's recreation, not a course.
1988_24833_000008_000000.wav|In fact, one thing this cat business seems to have established is that me and Pop fighting is the main cause of Mom's asthma.
1988_24833_000062_000003.wav|In that I can also choose what metropolitan area I want to be stationed in.
1988_24833_000033_000000.wav|I jump up, tipping over the bottle of soda on the way.
1988_24833_000051_000000.wav|"Hilda came to the beach with us," I say.
1988_24833_000049_000000.wav|"Goodness, who could that be so late?" says Mom.
1988_24833_000053_000001.wav|Come in and sit down."
1988_24833_000047_000001.wav|He says, "Hereafter I will only turn off your t v programs before they start, not in the middle."
1988_24833_000028_000001.wav|The story starts off with some nature shots of a farm and mountains in the background and this little kid playing with his grandfather.
1988_24833_000034_000002.wav|There'll be another western on tomorrow night."
1988_24833_000003_000000.wav|"HERE'S TO CAT!"
1988_24833_000064_000000.wav|"I'll have to check some more," says Tom.
1988_24833_000013_000000.wav|"They might," he grunts.
1988_24833_000058_000002.wav|Tom drinks a little more coffee and then he goes on: "The trouble is, I can't get married on this flower shop job."
1988_24833_000035_000000.wav|That's the last straw.
1988_24833_000024_000000.wav|"Sure.
1988_24833_000012_000000.wav|"Pop, it's a course.
1988_24833_000026_000000.wav|It's funny about fights.
1988_24833_000058_000000.wav|Tom says, "Thanks" and looks at Hilda, and she blushes.
1988_24833_000038_000002.wav|Knocks-that's something.
1988_24833_000008_000001.wav|So we both try to do a little better, and a lot of things we used to argue and fight about, like my jazz records, we just kid each other about now.
1988_24833_000021_000001.wav|It makes me think.
1988_24833_000035_000001.wav|I shout, "See?
1988_24833_000024_000002.wav|As long as there's a bone on the floor, the two of you worry it."
1988_24833_000038_000003.wav|Usually he just barges in.
1988_24833_000060_000000.wav|"Well, it's not just the pay.
1988_24833_000030_000000.wav|"Here, Davey old boy, we can do better than that tonight.
1988_24833_000009_000001.wav|It's a real lemon-just a lot of preaching about government and citizenship.
1988_24833_000018_000001.wav|Sometimes schools do let kids take a lot of soft courses, and then they're out on a limb later."
1988_24833_000032_000000.wav|He switches the channel.
1988_24833_000006_000003.wav|I'm not fixing to start an annex to Kate's cat home!"
1988_24833_000006_000002.wav|When are you getting rid of these cats?
1988_24833_000030_000001.wav|The Governor and the Mayor are on a t v debate about New York City school reorganization."
1988_24833_000058_000001.wav|Really.
1988_24833_000063_000000.wav|Pop says, "You sound like the recruiting officer himself.
1988_24833_000055_000001.wav|Tom stirs his coffee vigorously and takes one sip and puts the cup down.
1988_24833_000036_000000.wav|Pop looks at me prissily.
1988_24833_000068_000001.wav|"Here's to Cat!
1988_24833_000025_000001.wav|I go home, wondering if I really am at all like pop
1988_24833_000037_000000.wav|"It's your fault!
1988_24833_000036_000002.wav|Stop it and behave yourself.
1988_24833_000016_000000.wav|I go down to the flower shop to grouse to Tom.
1988_24833_000041_000000.wav|"But anyway, you shouldn't get so sore about an old television program that you shout 'Mop it up yourself' at me."
1988_24833_000004_000000.wav|The two stray kittens gradually make themselves at home.
1988_24833_000057_000000.wav|Pop doesn't look as surprised as I do.
1988_24833_000005_000000.wav|As for keeping cats in my room, that's pretty well forgotten.
1988_24833_000028_000003.wav|He's taking the kid for a walk when a thunderstorm blows up.
1988_24833_000046_000004.wav|Sorry I got sore."
1988_24833_000016_000001.wav|It's after Valentine's Day, and business is slack and the boss is out.
1988_24833_000027_000000.wav|We get a holiday Washington's Birthday, which is good because there's a t v program on Tuesday, the night before the holiday, that I hardly ever get to watch.
1988_24833_000017_000000.wav|"Why does Pop have to come butting into my business at school?

1988_24833_000050_000002.wav|I turn off the television set-I've lost track of what's happening, and it doesn't seem to be the grandfather who's the spook after all.
1988_24833_000057_000001.wav|"Congratulations!" he says.
1988_24833_000027_000003.wav|The program goes on till eleven o'clock, and Mom won't let me watch it on school nights.
1988_24833_000009_000003.wav|This is o k with the school-but not with pop
1988_24833_000013_000001.wav|"You're not going to loaf your way through school if I have anything to say about it."
1988_24833_000028_000000.wav|I get the pillows comfortably arranged on the floor, with a big bottle of soda and a bag of popcorn within easy reach.
1988_24833_000066_000001.wav|There's still enough left for one big glass.
1988_24833_000015_000003.wav|I'll be lucky if I have time to breathe.

1988_24833_000040_000000.wav|"Yeah, it's about over by now." I'm still sore, and besides Pop's still standing in my door, so I figure there's a hitch in this somewhere.
1988_24833_000048_000000.wav|Just as I get the t v on and settle down, the doorbell rings.
1988_24833_000038_000000.wav|I hear the t v going for a few minutes, then Pop turns it off and goes in the kitchen to talk to Mom.
1988_24833_000036_000001.wav|"You're getting altogether too upset about these programs.
1988_24833_000050_000004.wav|Then there's one of those moments of complete silence, with everyone looking embarrassed, before we all start to speak at once.
1988_24833_000037_000001.wav|Mop it up yourself!" I'm too mad now to care what I say. I charge down the hall to my room and slam the door.
1988_24833_000006_000000.wav|The only time we have any trouble from the cats is one evening when Pop comes home and the two kittens skid down the hall between his legs, with Cat after them.
1988_24833_000024_000001.wav|You're both impatient and curious, got to poke into everything.
1988_24833_000039_000001.wav|So o k, go ahead, you can finish it."

1988_24833_000026_000003.wav|I hardly know what starts it, but a fight boils up, and we're both breathing fire like dragons on the loose.
1988_24833_000015_000001.wav|He does, and for once I win a round-I keep music for this semester.
1988_24833_000050_000003.wav|It's the first time Hilda has been to our house, and Tom introduces her around.
1988_24833_000066_000002.wav|Pop brings out the champagne, and the cork blows and hits the ceiling.
1988_24833_000005_000003.wav|She doesn't pick them up, but just having them in the room sure doesn't give her asthma.
1988_24833_000046_000002.wav|I say, "Well, o k
1988_24833_000026_000001.wav|Pop and I can go along real smooth and easy for a while, and I think: Well, he really isn't a bad guy, and I'm growing up, we can see eye to eye-all that stuff.
1988_148538_000007_000001.wav|This is explained by what goes before.
1988_148538_000004_000003.wav|Amongst such a people a serious demeanor ceases to be peculiar to certain men, and becomes a habit of the nation.
1988_148538_000013_000001.wav|An Englishman calmly enjoys the real or imaginary advantages which in his opinion his country possesses. If he grants nothing to other nations, neither does he solicit anything for his own.
1988_148538_000002_000002.wav|They want something productive and substantial in their pleasures; they want to mix actual fruition with their joy.
1988_148538_000002_000004.wav|They prefer to these frivolous delights those more serious and silent amusements which are like business, and which do not drive business wholly from their minds.
1988_148538_000006_000005.wav|The former do not know-the latter forget; and the chief features of each picture are lost to them in a bewilderment of details.
1988_148538_000005_000002.wav|But it must not be supposed that, in the midst of all their toils, the people who live in democracies think themselves to be pitied; the contrary is remarked to be the case.
1988_148538_000003_000002.wav|I believe the seriousness of the Americans arises partly from their pride.
1988_148538_000003_000000.wav|I thought that the English constituted the most serious nation on the face of the earth, but I have since seen the Americans and have changed my opinion.
1988_148538_000004_000002.wav|Then there are in all classes a very large number of men constantly occupied with the serious affairs of the government; and those whose thoughts are not engaged in the direction of the commonwealth are wholly engrossed by the acquisition of a private fortune.
1988_148538_000002_000001.wav|Nor have they a greater inclination for the intellectual and refined amusements of the aristocratic classes.
1988_148538_000014_000003.wav|They stand unmoved in their solitary greatness, well assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show themselves off, and that no one will attempt to drive them from that position.
1988_148538_000015_000003.wav|Men living in democracies love their country just as they love themselves, and they transfer the habits of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation.
1988_148538_000014_000001.wav|As these privileges came to them by inheritance, they regard them in some sort as a portion of themselves, or at least as a natural right inherent in their own persons.
1988_148538_000004_000001.wav|This is more especially the case amongst those free nations which form democratic communities.
1988_148538_000006_000004.wav|In despotic States men know not how to act, because they are told nothing; in democratic nations they often act at random, because nothing is to be left untold.

1988_148538_000001_000000.wav|Chapter fifteen: Of The Gravity Of The Americans, And Why It Does Not Prevent Them From Often Committing Inconsiderate Actions
1988_148538_000003_000003.wav|In democratic countries even poor men entertain a lofty notion of their personal importance: they look upon themselves with complacency, and are apt to suppose that others are looking at them, too.
1988_148538_000002_000000.wav|Men who live in democratic countries do not value the simple, turbulent, or coarse diversions in which the people indulge in aristocratic communities: such diversions are thought by them to be puerile or insipid.
1988_148538_000011_000000.wav|All free nations are vainglorious, but national pride is not displayed by all in the same manner.
1988_148538_000013_000000.wav|Such is not the case with the English.
1988_148538_000015_000002.wav|As at any instant these same advantages may be lost, their possessors are constantly on the alert, and make a point of showing that they still retain them.
1988_148538_000008_000000.wav|In democracies men are never stationary; a thousand chances waft them to and fro, and their life is always the sport of unforeseen or (so to speak) extemporaneous circumstances.
1988_148538_000007_000000.wav|It is astonishing what imprudent language a public man may sometimes use in free countries, and especially in democratic States, without being compromised; whereas in absolute monarchies a few words dropped by accident are enough to unmask him forever, and ruin him without hope of redemption.
1988_148538_000002_000005.wav|An American, instead of going in a leisure hour to dance merrily at some place of public resort, as the fellows of his calling continue to do throughout the greater part of Europe, shuts himself up at home to drink.
1988_148538_000015_000000.wav|When, on the contrary, social conditions differ but little, the slightest privileges are of some importance; as every man sees around himself a million of people enjoying precisely similar or analogous advantages, his pride becomes craving and jealous, he clings to mere trifles, and doggedly defends them.
1988_148538_000006_000003.wav|There is one sort of ignorance which originates in extreme publicity.
1988_148538_000014_000004.wav|When an aristocracy carries on the public affairs, its national pride naturally assumes this reserved, indifferent, and haughty form, which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation.
1988_148538_000011_000003.wav|It would seem as if, doubting their own merit, they wished to have it constantly exhibited before their eyes.
1988_148538_000011_000002.wav|The most slender eulogium is acceptable to them; the most exalted seldom contents them; they unceasingly harass you to extort praise, and if you resist their entreaties they fall to praising themselves.
1988_148538_000005_000004.wav|Life would have no relish for them if they were delivered from the anxieties which harass them, and they show more attachment to their cares than aristocratic nations to their pleasures.
1988_148538_000015_000005.wav|An aristocratic class always differs greatly from the other classes of the nation, by the extent and perpetuity of its privileges; but it often happens that the only differences between the members who belong to it consist in small transient advantages, which may any day be lost or acquired.
1988_148538_000015_000007.wav|These persons then displayed towards each other precisely the same puerile jealousies which animate the men of democracies, the same eagerness to snatch the smallest advantages which their equals contested, and the same desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in possession.
1988_148538_000009_000004.wav|The habit of inattention must be considered as the greatest bane of the democratic character.
1988_148538_000013_000003.wav|It is remarkable that two nations, so recently sprung from the same stock, should be so opposite to one another in their manner of feeling and conversing.
1988_147956_000015_000001.wav|He was born like that.
1988_147956_000019_000001.wav|Yulka curled up like a baby rabbit and played with a grasshopper.
1988_147956_000021_000006.wav|When she coaxed and insisted, I repulsed her quite sternly.
1988_147956_000012_000001.wav|She made mrs Shimerda understand the friendly intention of our visit, and the Bohemian woman handled the loaves of bread and even smelled them, and examined the pies with lively curiosity, exclaiming, "Much good, much thank!"--and again she wrung grandmother's hand.
1988_147956_000019_000002.wav|Antonia pointed up to the sky and questioned me with her glance.
1988_147956_000005_000001.wav|I'd have interfered about the horses-the old man can understand some German-if I'd 'a' thought it would do any good.
1988_147956_000002_000003.wav|They made a gold ribbon across the prairie.
1988_147956_000013_000002.wav|His hazel eyes were little and shrewd, like his mother's, but more sly and suspicious; they fairly snapped at the food.
1988_147956_000004_000001.wav|"It's no better than a badger hole; no proper dugout at all.
1988_147956_000006_000000.wav|Grandmother looked interested.
1988_147956_000008_000000.wav|The land was growing rougher; I was told that we were approaching Squaw Creek, which cut up the west half of the Shimerdas' place and made the land of little value for farming.
1988_147956_000015_000002.wav|The others are smart.
1988_147956_000018_000000.wav|"Name?
1988_147956_000003_000001.wav|Their agreement with him was made before they left the old country, through a cousin of his, who was also a relative of mrs Shimerda.
1988_147956_000010_000000.wav|"Very glad, very glad!" she ejaculated.
1988_147956_000019_000000.wav|We sat down and made a nest in the long red grass.
1988_147956_000009_000009.wav|She shook grandmother's hand energetically.
1988_147956_000016_000001.wav|He wore no hat, and his thick, iron gray hair was brushed straight back from his forehead.
1988_147956_000011_000000.wav|Grandmother nodded consolingly.
1988_147956_000007_000001.wav|"Well, ma'm, it's politics.
1988_147956_000009_000004.wav|The door stood open, and a woman and a girl of fourteen ran out and looked up at us hopefully.
1988_147956_000022_000002.wav|Antonia reached him first, took his hand and kissed it.
1988_147956_000001_000003.wav|We clambered up to the front seat and jolted off past the little pond and along the road that climbed to the big cornfield.
1988_147956_000004_000000.wav|"If they're nice people, I hate to think of them spending the winter in that cave of Krajiek's," said grandmother.
1988_147956_000003_000005.wav|One son, Fuchs said, was well grown, and strong enough to work the land; but the father was old and frail and knew nothing about farming.
1988_147956_000009_000007.wav|She was not old, but she was certainly not young.
1988_147956_000016_000000.wav|At that moment the father came out of the hole in the bank.
1988_147956_000015_000003.wav|Ambrosch, he make good farmer." He struck Ambrosch on the back, and the boy smiled knowingly.
1988_147956_000013_000001.wav|He was nineteen years old, short and broad backed, with a close cropped, flat head, and a wide, flat face.
1988_147956_000016_000012.wav|In a moment we were running up the steep drawside together, Yulka trotting after us.
1988_147956_000014_000009.wav|As he approached us, he began to make uncouth noises, and held up his hands to show us his fingers, which were webbed to the first knuckle, like a duck's foot.
1988_147956_000009_000008.wav|Her face was alert and lively, with a sharp chin and shrewd little eyes.
1988_147956_000003_000004.wav|They could not speak enough English to ask for advice, or even to make their most pressing wants known.
1988_147956_000014_000008.wav|Even from a distance one could see that there was something strange about this boy.
1988_147956_000002_000004.wav|Occasionally one of the horses would tear off with his teeth a plant full of blossoms, and walk along munching it, the flowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate down toward them.
1988_147956_000013_000000.wav|The oldest son, Ambroz,--they called it Ambrosch,--came out of the cave and stood beside his mother.
1988_147956_000012_000000.wav|My grandmother always spoke in a very loud tone to foreigners, as if they were deaf.
1988_147956_000009_000003.wav|We drove up to this skeleton to tie our horses, and then I saw a door and window sunk deep in the draw bank.
1988_147956_000001_000001.wav|We were taking them some provisions, as they had come to live on a wild place where there was no garden or chicken house, and very little broken land.
1988_147956_000021_000007.wav|I did n't want her ring, and I felt there was something reckless and extravagant about her wishing to give it away to a boy she had never seen before.
1988_147956_000007_000002.wav|It would take me a long while to explain."
1988_147956_000001_000000.wav|ON Sunday morning Otto Fuchs was to drive us over to make the acquaintance of our new Bohemian neighbors.
1988_147956_000017_000005.wav|She looked at me, her eyes fairly blazing with things she could not say.
1988_147956_000010_000001.wav|Immediately she pointed to the bank out of which she had emerged and said, "House no good, house no good!"
1988_147956_000006_000001.wav|"Now, why is that, Otto?"
1988_147956_000009_000001.wav|Presently, against one of those banks, I saw a sort of shed, thatched with the same wine colored grass that grew everywhere.
1988_147956_000021_000002.wav|She was quick, and very eager.
1988_147956_000022_000001.wav|"Tatinek, Tatinek!" she shouted, and we ran to meet the old man who was coming toward us.
1988_147956_000002_000001.wav|The road ran about like a wild thing, avoiding the deep draws, crossing them where they were wide and shallow.
1988_147956_000017_000001.wav|We raced off toward Squaw Creek and did not stop until the ground itself stopped-fell away before us so abruptly that the next step would have been out into the tree tops.
1988_147956_000016_000006.wav|They looked calm, somehow, and skilled. His eyes were melancholy, and were set back deep under his brow.
1988_147956_000018_000003.wav|She pointed into the gold cottonwood tree behind whose top we stood and said again, "What name?"
1988_147956_000016_000009.wav|He was neatly dressed.
1988_147956_000016_000007.wav|His face was ruggedly formed, but it looked like ashes-like something from which all the warmth and light had died out.
1988_147956_000002_000000.wav|I could hardly wait to see what lay beyond that cornfield; but there was only red grass like ours, and nothing else, though from the high wagon seat one could look off a long way.
1988_147956_000019_000004.wav|I told her, and she repeated the word, making it sound like "ice." She pointed up to the sky, then to my eyes, then back to the sky, with movements so quick and impulsive that she distracted me, and I had no idea what she wanted.

174_84280_000011_000000.wav|I became grotesquely anxious to assure him that, indeed, she and I had been, as they say, innocent throughout our last day together.

174_84280_000015_000002.wav|The blood stained organized jealousies of religious intolerance, the delusions of nationality and cult and race, that black hatred which simple people and young people and common people cherish against all that is not in the likeness of themselves, cease to be the undisputed ruling forces of our collective life.
174_84280_000003_000008.wav|She who was so abundantly living, who could love like a burst of sunshine and give herself as God gives the world, is she here at all in this pile of industrious inexpert writing?

174_84280_000014_000001.wav|In Mary, it seems to me, I found both womanhood and fellowship, I found what many have dreamt of, love and friendship freely given, and I could do nothing but clutch at her to make her my possession.
174_84280_000014_000004.wav|And she was owned, she was mastered, she was forced into concealment.

174_168635_000018_000000.wav|When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried her off, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.

174_168635_000021_000000.wav|Only, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light.
174_168635_000038_000000.wav|Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read.

174_168635_000042_000002.wav|He saw a whole future stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light.

174_168635_000025_000000.wav|The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she thought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.
174_168635_000019_000001.wav|He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled with joy.
174_168635_000024_000000.wav|Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another being, poor little thing!

174_168635_000037_000000.wav|At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown.
174_168635_000024_000007.wav|Thus, from the very first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man.
174_168635_000027_000004.wav|To meet was to find each other.

174_168635_000017_000000.wav|Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty five years he had been alone in the world.
174_168635_000036_000001.wav|The poor child, who was used to being beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away in confusion.
174_168635_000024_000001.wav|She was so little when her mother left her, that she no longer remembered her.
174_168635_000029_000000.wav|And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality.

174_168635_000043_000001.wav|He had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect-incomplete aspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as personified in Javert.
174_168635_000040_000000.wav|To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly the whole of Jean Valjean's existence.
174_168635_000038_000001.wav|Sometimes, as he made the child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison.
174_168635_000030_000000.wav|Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well.
174_168635_000032_000002.wav|The first story contained, as we have said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean's housekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.
174_168635_000024_000002.wav|Like all children, who resemble young shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to love; she had not succeeded.
174_168635_000033_000003.wav|It was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival.

5895_34615_000026_000005.wav|Besides, when once the novelty of the laugh had passed over, Gwynplaine was intolerable for a woman to see, and impossible to contemplate.
5895_34615_000028_000000.wav|Gwynplaine had been made to order-at least, that was probable.
5895_34615_000029_000004.wav|Gwynplaine had yellow hair.
5895_34615_000019_000005.wav|It had been stamped for ever on his face.
5895_34615_000010_000001.wav|But was it nature?
5895_34615_000024_000002.wav|Moreover, it happened that on the slightest distraction, or the slightest emotion, the laugh, driven back for a moment, returned like a tide with an impulse which was irresistible in proportion to the force of the adverse emotion.
5895_34615_000013_000005.wav|It only requires to obliterate the root of the nose and to flatten the nostrils.
5895_34615_000023_000000.wav|Let us understand each other; we will explain.
5895_34615_000026_000006.wav|But he was tall, well made, and agile, and no way deformed, excepting in his face.
5895_34615_000027_000000.wav|This led to the presumption that Gwynplaine was rather a creation of art than a work of nature.
5895_34615_000029_000008.wav|The facial angle was powerful and surprisingly grand.
5895_34615_000013_000008.wav|Why not?
5895_34615_000023_000001.wav|The Manichaeans believed the absolute occasionally gives way, and that God Himself sometimes abdicates for a time.
5895_34615_000015_000000.wav|However it may have been, the manipulation of Gwynplaine had succeeded admirably.
5895_34615_000013_000003.wav|Man can do nothing to create beauty, but everything to produce ugliness.
5895_34615_000022_000000.wav|An everlasting laugh!
5895_34615_000020_000004.wav|All parody which borders on folly, all irony which borders on wisdom, were condensed and amalgamated in that face.
5895_34615_000019_000004.wav|The laugh which he had not placed, himself, on his brow, on his eyelids, on his mouth, he could not remove.
5895_34615_000020_000000.wav|It was like a head of Medusa, but Medusa hilarious.
5895_34615_000018_000000.wav|Thus he rose rapidly in the fair ground and at the cross roads to the very satisfactory renown of a horrible man.
5895_34615_000029_000007.wav|The operation, whatever it had been, which had deprived his features of harmony, and put all their flesh into disorder, had had no effect on the bony structure of his head.
5895_34615_000019_000010.wav|All his emotions, whatever they might have been, augmented his strange face of joy, or to speak more correctly, aggravated it.
5895_34615_000024_000001.wav|It was a terrible effort, and an insupportable tension.
5895_34615_000013_000000.wav|If, in the presence of this mountebank-for he was one-the first impression of gaiety wore off, and the man were observed with attention, traces of art were to be recognized.
5895_34615_000023_000005.wav|For Gwynplaine the postscript was this: by the force of his will, and by concentrating all his attention, and on condition that no emotion should come to distract and turn away the fixedness of his effort, he could manage to suspend the everlasting rictus of his face, and to throw over it a kind of tragic veil, and then the spectator laughed no longer; he shuddered.
5895_34615_000021_000002.wav|What a weight for the shoulders of a man-an everlasting laugh!
5895_34615_000009_000000.wav|Nature had been prodigal of her kindness to Gwynplaine.
5895_34615_000026_000000.wav|On seeing Gwynplaine, all laughed.
5895_34615_000009_000001.wav|She had bestowed on him a mouth opening to his ears, ears folding over to his eyes, a shapeless nose to support the spectacles of the grimace maker, and a face that no one could look upon without laughing.
5895_34615_000019_000011.wav|Any astonishment which might seize him, any suffering which he might feel, any anger which might take possession of him, any pity which might move him, would only increase this hilarity of his muscles.
5895_34615_000020_000006.wav|One corner of the mouth was raised, in mockery of the human race; the other side, in blasphemy of the gods.
5895_34615_000017_000003.wav|Hypochondriacs were cured by the sight of him alone.
5895_34615_000026_000004.wav|The joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid; they submitted to it gladly, but almost mechanically.
5895_34615_000028_000004.wav|Surgical sculpture of the kind could never have succeeded except on a very young child, and consequently on one having little consciousness of what happened to him, and who might easily take a wound for a sickness.
5895_34615_000011_000000.wav|Two slits for eyes, a hiatus for a mouth, a snub protuberance with two holes for nostrils, a flattened face, all having for the result an appearance of laughter; it is certain that nature never produces such perfection single handed.
5895_34615_000013_000007.wav|Had Gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation?
5895_34615_000023_000004.wav|The whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript.
5895_34615_000028_000002.wav|The death's head retains them.
5895_34615_000023_000002.wav|So also of the will.
5895_34615_000023_000003.wav|We do not admit that it can ever be utterly powerless.
5895_34615_000025_000000.wav|With this exception, Gwynplaine's laugh was everlasting.
5895_34615_000017_000005.wav|One day the executioner came, and Gwynplaine made him laugh.
5895_34615_000016_000000.wav|Of what providence?
5895_34615_000026_000003.wav|The man was frightful.
5895_34615_000030_000002.wav|By means of it he gained his living.
5895_34615_000027_000003.wav|They had left the body intact, and retouched only the face.
5895_34615_000029_000001.wav|His articulations usefully displaced and fashioned to bending the wrong way, had received the education of a clown, and could, like the hinges of a door, move backwards and forwards.
5895_34615_000017_000004.wav|He was avoided by folks in mourning, because they were compelled to laugh when they saw him, without regard to their decent gravity.
5895_34622_000042_000001.wav|"Citizens and townsmen, the Gregorian form of worship, this great progress, is opposed in Italy to the Ambrosial ritual, and in Spain to the Mozarabic ceremonial, and has achieved its triumph over them with difficulty."
5895_34622_000011_000004.wav|The Green Box had but two windows, one at each extremity, and at the back a door with steps to let down.
5895_34622_000045_000003.wav|Ursus was in everything-in the piece, in the company, in the kitchen, in the orchestra.
5895_34622_000018_000001.wav|The passers by were immediately struck with wonder.
5895_34622_000037_000001.wav|As it dropped it set at liberty three legs on hinges, which supported the panel when let down, and which placed themselves straight on the ground like the legs of a table, and supported it above the earth like a platform.
5895_34622_000045_000000.wav|The public stood without, in the street, in the fair, forming a semicircle round the stage, exposed to the sun and the showers; an arrangement which made rain less desirable for theatres in those days than now.
5895_34622_000029_000001.wav|It now contained two beds.
5895_34622_000018_000005.wav|The curiosity of one place exhausted, they passed on to another.
5895_34622_000022_000000.wav|These two gipsies, picked up by the philosopher from amongst the vagabondage of cities and suburbs, were ugly and young, and were called, by order of Ursus, the one Phoebe, and the other Venus.
5895_34622_000005_000002.wav|In Gwynplaine evil thoughts never ripened, and he had therefore no remorse.
5895_34622_000020_000000.wav|This "fortune" had allowed Ursus, who was the administrator of Gwynplaine's success, to have the chariot of his dreams constructed-that is to say, a caravan large enough to carry a theatre, and to sow science and art in the highways.
5895_34622_000012_000000.wav|This was the old establishment of Ursus, its proportions augmented by success, and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre.
5895_34622_000017_000000.wav|Ursus, it may be remembered, had made Gwynplaine his pupil.
5895_34622_000011_000003.wav|This green colour had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage, which was known in all the fair grounds as The Green Box.
5895_34622_000044_000001.wav|The curtain, which we call drop nowadays, was a checked silk, with squares of contrasted colours.
5895_34622_000031_000005.wav|A loft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes, and on opening a trap door lamps appeared, producing wonders of light.
5895_34622_000038_000001.wav|It was, perhaps, for some such pious invention that Solon kicked out Thespis.
5895_34622_000044_000000.wav|The scene of the Green Box represented a landscape painted by Ursus; and as he did not know how to paint, it represented a cavern just as well as a landscape.
5895_34622_000031_000002.wav|A piece of stuff fell over them, and answered the purpose of concealment.
5895_34622_000029_000002.wav|In the opposite corner was the kitchen.
5895_34622_000012_000002.wav|This was Homo. The old coachman who drove the horses was the philosopher himself.
5895_34622_000017_000002.wav|So soon as the growth of the child had rendered him fitted for it, he had brought him out on the stage-that is, he had produced him in front of the van.
5895_34622_000005_000003.wav|Sometimes he felt regret.
5895_34622_000003_000000.wav|CHAPTER eight.
5895_34622_000019_000000.wav|"What a good turn they did you there, my boy!" said Ursus.
5895_34622_000026_000002.wav|Gwynplaine had, besides, for his work and for his feats of strength, round his neck and over his shoulders, an esclavine of leather.
5895_34622_000040_000000.wav|The chariot, of the colour of hope, which carried Ursus, Gwynplaine, and their fortunes, and in front of which Fibi and Vinos trumpeted like figures of Fame, played its part of this grand Bohemian and literary brotherhood.
5895_34622_000026_000004.wav|Ursus and Homo took charge of each other.
5895_34622_000045_000007.wav|Often when they appeared side by side on the stage-Ursus in his tightly laced bear's skin, Homo with his wolf's skin fitting still better-no one could tell which was the beast.
5895_34622_000031_000003.wav|The compartment behind belonged to the men, the compartment in front to the women; the compartment in the middle, separating the two sexes, was the stage.
5895_34622_000017_000001.wav|Unknown people had worked upon his face; he, on the other hand, had worked on his mind, and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could of thought.
5895_34622_000034_000000.wav|"Father, you look like a sorcerer!"
5895_34622_000004_000000.wav|NOT ONLY HAPPINESS, BUT PROSPERITY.
5895_34622_000039_000000.wav|For all that Thespis has lasted much longer than is generally believed. The travelling theatre is still in existence.
5895_34622_000024_000000.wav|Phoebe cooked; Venus scrubbed the temple.
5895_34622_000031_000000.wav|The caravan was divided into three compartments, partitioned from each other.
5895_34622_000014_000000.wav|From this-Gwynplaine had become famous.
5895_34622_000028_000000.wav|The eye which could penetrate within this structure and its internal arrangements might have perceived in a corner, fastened to the planks, and immovable on its four wheels, the old hut of Ursus, placed on half pay, allowed to rust, and from thenceforth dispensed the labour of rolling as Ursus was relieved from the labour of drawing it.
5895_34622_000026_000003.wav|He took charge of the horses.
5895_34622_000038_000000.wav|This opening looked for all the world like a "mouth of hell," in the words of the itinerant Puritan preachers, who turned away from it with horror.
5895_34622_000011_000007.wav|In front, on a ledge fastened to the van, with the window for a door, behind the horses and by the side of an old man who held the reins and directed the team, two gipsy women, dressed as goddesses, sounded their trumpets.
5895_34622_000037_000002.wav|This exposed the stage, which was thus enlarged by the platform in front.
5895_34622_000036_000000.wav|"Then I look, perhaps, like what I am."
5895_34629_000009_000004.wav|A large wooden balcony, roofed over, and supported on posts, on which the rooms of the first story opened, ran round the three fronts of the interior facade of the house, making two right angles.
5895_34629_000021_000002.wav|Still it remained local.
5895_34629_000020_000000.wav|Curiosity, applause, receipts, crowds, the Laughing Man monopolized everything.
5895_34629_000011_000000.wav|Ursus had made his arrangements with the tavern keeper, Master Nicless, who, owing to his respect for the law, would not admit the wolf without charging him extra.
5895_34629_000051_000001.wav|Of Dea-of nothing-of everything-of the depths.
5895_34629_000021_000000.wav|"'Chaos Vanquished' is 'Chaos Victor,'" said Ursus, appropriating half Gwynplaine's success, and taking the wind out of his sails, as they say at sea.
5895_34629_000046_000001.wav|He would make a famous scoundrel."
5895_34629_000012_000004.wav|Pay and pass in. Under the placard announcing the Laughing Man was a piece of wood, painted white, hung on two nails, on which was written in charcoal in large letters the title of Ursus's grand piece, "Chaos Vanquished."
5895_34629_000021_000001.wav|That success was prodigious.
5895_34629_000039_000000.wav|"Do you know that man?"
5895_34629_000019_000001.wav|There was a travelling menagerie, where was to be seen a performing tiger, who, lashed by the keeper, snapped at the whip and tried to swallow the lash.
5895_34629_000007_000000.wav|A cathedral is a sign.
5895_34629_000046_000000.wav|"What a pity that he should not be a lord.
5895_34629_000013_000000.wav|In the centre of the balcony, precisely opposite the Green Box, and in a compartment having for entrance a window reaching to the ground, there had been partitioned off a space "for the nobility."
5895_34629_000049_000000.wav|A certain vagrancy in our spirits impels us to take walks at night, and to saunter under the stars.
5895_34629_000049_000001.wav|There is a mysterious expectation in youth. Therefore it is that we are prone to wander out in the night, without an object.
5895_34629_000030_000001.wav|It was composed of watermen, chairmen, coachmen, and bargemen, and sailors, just ashore, spending their wages in feasting and women.
5895_34629_000016_000000.wav|They began their performances.
5895_34629_000025_000000.wav|Between the acts Ursus exhibited his power as an engastrimist, and executed marvels of ventriloquism.
5895_34629_000034_000001.wav|He did not come every evening, but when he came he led the public-applause grew into acclamation-success rose not to the roof, for there was none, but to the clouds, for there were plenty of them. Which clouds (seeing that there was no roof) sometimes wept over the masterpiece of Ursus.
5895_34629_000016_000001.wav|The crowd immediately flocked to them, but the compartment for the nobility remained empty.
5895_34629_000004_000002.wav|Ursus had been tempted by the bowling green, which had one great recommendation, that it was always fair day there, even in winter.
5895_34629_000012_000002.wav|By the side of the door was constructed off hand, by means of an empty barrel, a box for the money taker, who was sometimes Fibi and sometimes Vinos.
5895_34629_000009_000005.wav|The windows of the ground floor made boxes, the pavement of the court the pit, and the balcony the gallery. The Green Box, reared against the wall, was thus in front of a theatre. It was very like the Globe, where they played "Othello," "King Lear," and "The Tempest."
5895_34629_000022_000000.wav|The glory of Gwynplaine had not passed London Bridge.
5895_34629_000034_000000.wav|This connoisseur was suddenly fascinated, and had adopted the Laughing Man.
5895_34629_000018_000001.wav|There was a circus of women, ringing from morning till night with a magnificent peal of all sorts of instruments-psalteries, drums, rebecks, micamons, timbrels, reeds, dulcimers, gongs, chevrettes, bagpipes, German horns, English eschaqueils, pipes, flutes, and flageolets.
5895_34629_000013_000001.wav|It was large enough to hold, in two rows, ten spectators.
5895_34629_000022_000001.wav|It was not great enough yet to re echo throughout the city.
5895_34629_000021_000005.wav|The sea is a wall; and if Voltaire-a thing which he very much regretted when it was too late-had not thrown a bridge over to Shakespeare, Shakespeare might still be in England, on the other side of the wall, a captive in insular glory.
5895_34629_000050_000001.wav|The empty taverns were shut up, and the lower room in the Tadcaster Inn was dark, except where, in some corner, a solitary candle lighted a last reveller. An indistinct glow gleamed through the window shutters of the half closed tavern, as Gwynplaine, pensive, content, and dreaming, happy in a haze of divine joy, passed backwards and forwards in front of the half open door.
5895_34629_000030_000003.wav|All these flowed from the street into the theatre, and poured back from the theatre into the tap.
5895_34629_000010_000000.wav|In a corner behind the Green Box was a stable.
5895_34629_000051_000000.wav|Of what was he thinking?
5895_34629_000022_000002.wav|At least not at first.
5895_34629_000006_000004.wav|He entered heaven only by the artists' door.
5895_34629_000029_000000.wav|Then he added, "I must not mistake them, for delicacy of taste, for the Atrobates, who people Berkshire, or the Belgians, who inhabited Somersetshire, nor for the Parisians, who founded York."

5895_34629_000018_000000.wav|Besides the small fry, the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers, real performances took place on the green.
5895_34629_000030_000000.wav|At every performance the yard of the inn, transformed into a pit, was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience.
5895_34629_000006_000000.wav|London, take it all in all, has some good in it.
5895_34629_000020_000002.wav|Nothing was thought of but the Green Box.

5895_34629_000052_000001.wav|A few steps away from it was far enough for him.
5895_34629_000025_000002.wav|These were remarkable talents.
5895_34629_000002_000000.wav|CHAPTER three.
5895_34629_000012_000001.wav|The sitting room of the tavern had, as we have seen, an inside door which opened into the court.
5895_34629_000025_000001.wav|He imitated every cry which occurred in the audience-a song, a cry, enough to startle, so exact the imitation, the singer or the crier himself; and now and then he copied the hubbub of the public, and whistled as if there were a crowd of people within him.
5895_34629_000016_000002.wav|With that exception their success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its parallel.
5895_34629_000003_000000.wav|WHERE THE PASSER BY REAPPEARS.
5895_34629_000036_000000.wav|They had a great friend in this unknown visitor.
5895_34629_000047_000001.wav|Except a few words exchanged now and then with the tavern keeper, they held no communication with any of those who were living, either permanently or temporarily, in the inn; and continued to keep to themselves.
5895_34629_000012_000003.wav|This was managed much as at present.
5895_34629_000040_000000.wav|"Of course I do."
5895_34629_000045_000000.wav|Then as he redescended the steps at the back of the Green Box, to enter the inn, Master Nicless let fall this profound reflection, so deep as to be unintelligible,--

1272_141231_000012_000003.wav|But as soon as the scores began to mount and eliminations cut into their ranks, there was complete silence after dark.
1272_141231_000019_000000.wav|"Out!" was the single snarled word of the response.
1272_141231_000008_000001.wav|He reacted-but his blade just met air.

1272_141231_000013_000002.wav|Someone spoke his name.
1272_141231_000036_000001.wav|Walking on his knees.
1272_141231_000011_000006.wav|The nagging memory of the previous night loomed up then, and he turned it over and over in his mind, examining it from all sides.
1272_141231_000036_000003.wav|At last.
1272_141231_000028_000002.wav|Others had died before during the Twenties, and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat.
1272_141231_000015_000001.wav|The other voice snapped with a harsh urgency, clearly used to command.
1272_141231_000036_000002.wav|No, not walking, falling.
1272_141231_000024_000000.wav|"That's all he needs too," Brion grunted, opening his eyes to look at the wiry length of the man at the other end of the long mat.
1272_141231_000011_000002.wav|The buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation.

1272_141231_000031_000000.wav|When the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his second's startled grasp, and ran forward.
1272_141231_000026_000005.wav|This was allowed.
1272_141231_000010_000000.wav|"One minute," a voice said, and the time buzzer sounded.

1272_141231_000012_000004.wav|Particularly so on this last night, when only two of the little cubicles were occupied, the thousands of others standing with dark, empty doors.
1272_141231_000011_000000.wav|Brion had carefully conditioned the reflex in himself.
1272_141231_000014_000002.wav|Whoever said you could was making a big mistake and there is going to be trouble-"
1272_141231_000033_000002.wav|If anything, he was pressing the attack.

1272_141231_000018_000001.wav|He must have drawn his gun, because the intruder said quickly, "Put that away.

1272_141231_000033_000000.wav|Brion saw something close to panic on his opponent's face when the man finally recognized his error.
1272_141231_000032_000001.wav|He didn't attempt to attack, just let Brion wear himself out against the firm shield of his defense.
1272_141231_000026_000000.wav|Every man who entered the Twenties had his own training tricks. Brion had a few individual ones that had helped him so far.
1272_128104_000006_000009.wav|We fully admit that it is extremely amusing and, no doubt, mr Quilter is quite earnest in his endeavours to elevate art to the dignity of manual labour, but the extraordinary vulgarity of the style alone will always be sufficient to prevent these Sententiae Artis from being anything more than curiosities of literature. mr Quilter has missed his chance; for he has failed even to make himself the Tupper of Painting.
1272_128104_000006_000008.wav|On the whole, the book will not do.

1272_128104_000005_000009.wav|As for etchings, they are of two kinds-British and foreign.
1272_128104_000005_000001.wav|Sculpture he regards as 'Painting's poor relation'; so, with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the 'rough modelling' of Tanagra figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts; but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality.
1272_128104_000005_000007.wav|Painting, he tells us, is 'of a different quality to mathematics,' and finish in art is 'adding more fact'!
1272_128104_000003_000005.wav|After listening so long to the Don Quixote of art, to listen once to Sancho Panza is both salutary and refreshing.

1272_128104_000003_000000.wav|There is a healthy bank holiday atmosphere about this book which is extremely pleasant.
1272_128104_000007_000001.wav|By Harry Quilter, m a (Isbister.)
1272_128104_000005_000006.wav|That there is a difference between colour and colours, that an artist, be he portrait painter or dramatist, always reveals himself in his manner, are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him; but mr Quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art, with the exception of mr Whistler.
1272_128104_000003_000002.wav|He rollicks through art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer.
1272_128104_000005_000008.wav|Portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy; however, even for the emotional artist there is hope, as a portrait can be converted into a picture 'by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct'!
1272_128104_000005_000013.wav|And then the picture he draws of the ideal home, where everything, though ugly, is hallowed by domestic memories, and where beauty appeals not to the heartless eye but the family affections; 'baby's chair there, and the mother's work basket . . . near the fire, and the ornaments Fred brought home from India on the mantel board'!
1272_128104_000006_000003.wav|Far from it.
1272_128104_000003_000001.wav|mr Quilter is entirely free from affectation of any kind.
1272_128104_000005_000000.wav|About artists and their work mr Quilter has, of course, a great deal to say.
3536_8226_000016_000001.wav|I don't believe a bit of his rights."
3536_8226_000029_000000.wav|Bozzle paused a moment before he replied, and then smiled as he spoke.
3536_8226_000029_000004.wav|I ain't got no evidence, mr Trevelyan.
3536_8226_000005_000008.wav|But now, when a demand was made upon Bozzle to violate the sanctity of the clergyman's house, and withdraw the child by force or stratagem, she began to perceive that the palmy days of the Trevelyan affair were over for them, and that it would be wise on her husband's part gradually to back out of the gentleman's employment.
3536_8226_000027_000000.wav|"You mean the Colonel, sir.
3536_8226_000026_000012.wav|He looked up for a moment at Bozzle, and then asked him a question.
3536_8226_000020_000002.wav|Drat 'em all; what is it they wants?
3536_8226_000008_000000.wav|"Gammon, Bozzle."
3536_8226_000021_000012.wav|mrs Bozzle, who well understood that business was business, and that wives were not business, felt no anger at this, and handed her husband his best coat.
3536_8226_000031_000001.wav|"He cursed and swore as made even me feel bad."
3536_8226_000019_000000.wav|"It's love for her as has done it then," said Bozzle, shaking his head.
3536_8226_000020_000000.wav|"I'm not a taking of her part, b A woman as has a husband as finds her with her wittels regular, and with what's decent and comfortable beside, ought to be contented.
3536_8226_000013_000002.wav|The paternal parent has a right to his infants, no doubt." That was Bozzle's law.
3536_8226_000014_000000.wav|"I don't believe it, b"
3536_8226_000018_000002.wav|"I'll tell you what it is, b," exclaimed mrs Bozzle, "it's my belief as he ain't quite right up here;" and mrs Bozzle touched her forehead.
3536_8226_000011_000000.wav|"It ain't to be done, you know," said Bozzle.
3536_8226_000021_000013.wav|The well brushed hat was fetched from a cupboard, and it was astonishing to see how easily and how quickly the outer respectability of Bozzle was restored.
3536_8226_000026_000007.wav|And all work had ceased with him.
3536_8226_000013_000000.wav|"It ain't to be done anyways;--not in my way of business.
3536_8226_000021_000009.wav|mrs Bozzle had set a chair for him, but he had declined to sit down.
3536_8226_000027_000002.wav|He have been up all this month, sir."
3536_8226_000012_000000.wav|"Of course it ain't," said mrs Bozzle.
3536_8226_000026_000006.wav|As he went about, his eyes were ever cast downwards, and he walked with a quick shuffling gait, and he suspected others, feeling that he himself was suspected.
3536_8226_000004_000003.wav|With Hugh Stanbury, Trevelyan had had a direct quarrel.
3536_8226_000024_000000.wav|"Why not?" Trevelyan could perceive at once that the authority which he had once respected had gone from the man.
3536_8226_000031_000000.wav|"He's disturbed in his mind,--quite 'orrid," Bozzle said when he got back to his wife.
3536_8226_000020_000008.wav|Bozzle, who had stood at the inner door, saw that the gentleman was mr Trevelyan.
3536_8226_000020_000003.wav|They don't know what they wants.
3536_8226_000024_000001.wav|Bozzle away from his own home, out on business, with his coat buttoned over his breast, and his best hat in his hand, was aware that he commanded respect,--and he could carry himself accordingly.
3536_8226_000020_000007.wav|mrs Bozzle going into the passage, opened it herself, and saw a strange gentleman.
3536_8226_000017_000002.wav|He'll get the child fast enough if he'll go before the court."
3536_8226_000024_000003.wav|But he had been found with his coat off, and a baby in his arms, and he could not recover himself.
3536_8226_000026_000009.wav|And he knew it all.
3536_8226_000015_000000.wav|"But he have, I tell you."
3536_8226_000010_000003.wav|We'd all be shewed up in the papers as that black, that they'd hoot us along the streets.
3536_8226_000020_000006.wav|But as for this here child, b--." At that moment there came a knock at the door.
3536_8226_000010_000004.wav|It ain't the regular line of business, Bozzle; and there ain't no good to be got, never, by going off the regular line." Whereupon Bozzle scratched his head and again read the letter.
3536_8226_000021_000003.wav|Then Bozzle came forward and introduced his wife.
3536_8226_000021_000011.wav|"Perhaps you could put on your coat, and walk out with me for a few minutes," said Trevelyan.
3536_8226_000028_000000.wav|"They haven't met?"
3536_23268_000028_000000.wav|"It is not the first time, I believe, you have acted contrary to that, Miss Milner," replied mrs Horton, and affected a tenderness of voice, to soften the harshness of her words.
3536_23268_000041_000000.wav|After a few minutes' pause, and some little embarrassment on the part of mrs Horton, at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct, she asked Miss Milner, "if she would now have any tea?"
3536_23268_000006_000000.wav|She, however, flattered herself that what she had said might be excused as a mistake, the lapse of memory, or some other trifling fault, when he should know the truth.
3536_23268_000008_000000.wav|"I mistook-for I had before given my word that I should pass it abroad."
3536_23268_000021_000000.wav|"I command you to stay at home this evening." And he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door.
3536_23268_000040_000002.wav|Dorriforth read on, and seemed afraid of looking up, lest he should see what he could not have pardoned.
3536_23268_000047_000001.wav|She was going to reply, but found she could not, without accompanying her words with tears, therefore, after the first attempt, she desisted.
3536_23268_000013_000000.wav|"I do."
3536_23268_000019_000000.wav|"Miss Milner, you shall not leave the house this evening."
3536_23268_000025_000000.wav|"What could be worse, Madam?" cried Miss Milner; "am not I disappointed of the ball?"
3536_23268_000006_000002.wav|Her guardian looked astonished.
1462_170145_000025_000000.wav|Alexander flushed angrily.
1462_170145_000017_000003.wav|"What am I to do, Hilda?"
1462_170145_000028_000000.wav|"Hilda you'd better think a while longer before you do that.
1462_170145_000034_000001.wav|Try him once again."
1462_170145_000015_000000.wav|"And I," she whispered,--"I felt that you were feeling that.
1462_170145_000020_000003.wav|I'm too fond of him."
1462_170145_000008_000001.wav|"Sit down, Hilda; you're wet through.
1462_170145_000031_000001.wav|Don't do anything like that rashly." His face grew troubled. "You wouldn't be happy.
1462_170145_000017_000001.wav|I've been up in Canada with my bridge, and I arranged not to come to New York until after you had gone.
1462_170145_000030_000000.wav|Alexander started to speak, but caught himself.
1462_170145_000027_000003.wav|When he looked over his shoulder she was lacing her boots.
1462_170145_000020_000002.wav|Only not Mac.
1462_170145_000026_000000.wav|"Under such circumstances, infinitely!"
1462_170145_000012_000001.wav|"Did you think I had forgotten you were in town, Hilda?
1462_170145_000006_000000.wav|He was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints nervously.
1462_170145_000003_000002.wav|Besides his sleeping room and bath, there was a large room, formerly a painter's studio, which he used as a study and office.
1462_170145_000009_000003.wav|I've been through this a hundred times to day.
1462_170145_000009_000005.wav|I was all right until I knew you were in town.
1462_170145_000013_000000.wav|Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve.
1462_170145_000029_000001.wav|I suppose I would better do it without telling you.
1462_170145_000004_000001.wav|When Alexander came back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made himself comfortable, and settled down at his desk, where he began checking over estimate sheets.
1462_170145_000012_000003.wav|There is a letter for you there, in my desk drawer.
1462_170145_000035_000000.wav|She looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands.
1462_170145_000031_000002.wav|You are not that kind of woman.
1462_170145_000006_000002.wav|There was something about him that made Hilda wish herself at her hotel again, in the street below, anywhere but where she was.
1462_170145_000008_000003.wav|"Here, put your feet on this stool. You don't mean to say you walked down-and without overshoes!"
1462_170145_000009_000007.wav|But you won't let me write to you, and I had to see you after that letter, that terrible letter you wrote me when you got home."
1462_170145_000032_000004.wav|And he threw it back at me a second time."
1462_170145_000004_000005.wav|He stood for a moment in awkward constraint, his pipe in his hand.
1462_170145_000013_000002.wav|Did you write to me?
1462_170145_000027_000001.wav|He got up and went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out.
1462_170145_000032_000001.wav|She closed her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled.
1462_170145_000010_000001.wav|"Is this the way you mean to answer it, Hilda?" he asked unsteadily.
1462_170145_000018_000000.wav|"That's what I wanted to see you about, Bartley.
1462_170145_000011_000000.wav|She was afraid to look up at him.
1462_170145_000022_000000.wav|"Indeed I'm not."
1462_170145_000021_000000.wav|Alexander moved restlessly.
1462_170145_000009_000002.wav|Can't you see, Bartley, that I'm terribly frightened?
1462_170145_000007_000003.wav|That's all.
1462_170145_000029_000000.wav|She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot heel down firmly. "No; I'm telling you what I've made up my mind to do.
1462_170145_000033_000000.wav|She felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly.
1462_170145_000011_000003.wav|"I came to tell you that I'm willing to do as you asked me.
1462_170145_000007_000004.wav|Good night; I'm going now." She turned and her hand closed on the door knob.
1462_170145_000007_000002.wav|I saw that interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you.
1462_170145_000003_000004.wav|Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror.
1462_170145_000002_000000.wav|On the last Saturday in April, the New York "Times" published an account of the strike complications which were delaying Alexander's New Jersey bridge, and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on West Tenth Street.
1462_170145_000012_000008.wav|"They never did to me."
1462_170145_000005_000002.wav|"Won't you sit down?"
1462_170145_000027_000002.wav|He heard Hilda moving about behind him.
1462_170145_000024_000003.wav|It's because they can't be at the mercy of the man they love any longer."
1462_170145_000018_000003.wav|I'm going to marry."
1462_170145_000020_000000.wav|"Oh, it doesn't matter much!
1462_170145_000012_000000.wav|Alexander sat down on the arm of her chair.
1462_170145_000013_000004.wav|Then I wouldn't have come."
1462_170145_000008_000002.wav|Let me take off your coat-and your boots; they're oozing water." He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes, while Hilda shrank into the chair.
1462_170145_000008_000000.wav|Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm.
1462_170145_000028_000001.wav|I don't know what I ought to say, but I don't believe you'd be happy; truly I don't.
1462_170145_000003_000005.wav|Alexander's big work table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the couch hung the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color and spirit, a study of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted in his youth by a man who had since become a portrait painter of international renown.
1462_170145_000025_000001.wav|"So it's better to be at the mercy of a man you don't love?"
1462_170145_000015_000001.wav|But when I came, I thought I had been mistaken."
1462_170145_000011_000004.wav|But it's no use talking about that now.
1462_170145_000009_000000.wav|Hilda hid her face in her hands.
1462_170145_000009_000004.wav|Don't be any more angry than you can help.
1462_170145_000020_000001.wav|One of them.
1462_170145_000016_000000.wav|Alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room.
1462_170145_000017_000002.wav|Then, when your manager added two more weeks, I was already committed." He dropped upon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees.
1462_170145_000005_000000.wav|"Come in," he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her.
1462_170145_000004_000002.wav|It was after nine o'clock and he was lighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a sound at his door. He started and listened, holding the burning match in his hand; again he heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap.
1462_170145_000007_000000.wav|"Of course I know, Bartley," she said at last, "that after this you won't owe me the least consideration.
1462_170145_000011_000005.wav|Give me my things, please." She put her hand out toward the fender.
1462_170145_000014_000001.wav|"I didn't know it before, Hilda, on my honor I didn't, but I believe it was because, deep down in me somewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just this.
1462_170145_000034_000000.wav|"Try him again, Hilda.
1462_170145_000031_000004.wav|"You see, you are different, Hilda.
1462_170145_000004_000003.wav|He rose and crossed the room quickly.
1462_170145_000012_000004.wav|It was to have reached you on the steamer.
1462_170145_000007_000001.wav|But we sail on Tuesday.
1462_170145_000003_000003.wav|It was furnished with the cast off possessions of his bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered for friends of his who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings.
1462_170145_000028_000002.wav|Aren't you trying to frighten me?"
1462_170145_000014_000002.wav|I've watched that door all day.
1462_170145_000030_000001.wav|When Hilda rose he sat down on the arm of her chair and drew her back into it.
1462_170145_000012_000007.wav|Marks on paper mean something to you." He paused.
1462_170145_000029_000002.wav|But afterward I shan't have an opportunity to explain, for I shan't be seeing you again."
1462_170145_000014_000003.wav|I've jumped up if the fire crackled.
1462_170145_000021_000001.wav|"Are you joking, Hilda?"
1462_170145_000032_000003.wav|Only one.
1462_170145_000014_000004.wav|I think I have felt that you were coming." He bent his face over her hair.
1462_170145_000005_000001.wav|He pointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable.
1462_170145_000003_000001.wav|His business often called him to New York, and he had kept an apartment there for years, subletting it when he went abroad for any length of time.
1462_170145_000006_000001.wav|The yellow light from the student's lamp fell on his hands and the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking jacket, but his flushed face and big, hard head were in the shadow.
1462_170145_000001_000000.wav|CHAPTER nine
1462_170145_000009_000006.wav|If you'd sent me a note, or telephoned me, or anything!
1462_170145_000018_000002.wav|Only I'll do it more completely.
1462_170145_000009_000001.wav|"I was afraid to take a cab.
1462_170145_000012_000006.wav|I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a letter would be better than nothing.
1462_170142_000038_000000.wav|"I understand, Bartley.
1462_170142_000002_000003.wav|The room was empty when he entered.
1462_170142_000002_000009.wav|I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
1462_170142_000038_000007.wav|I can do that."
1462_170142_000016_000000.wav|He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
1462_170142_000001_000001.wav|The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
1462_170142_000024_000002.wav|I have thought about it until I am worn out."
1462_170142_000022_000001.wav|She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
1462_170142_000008_000000.wav|Bartley bent lower over the fire.
1462_170142_000039_000000.wav|"I can't," he said heavily.
1462_170142_000010_000000.wav|"What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice.
1462_170142_000019_000003.wav|It tortures me every minute."
1462_170142_000038_000006.wav|"You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?
1462_170142_000044_000004.wav|And I've got nobody but you.
1462_170142_000048_000001.wav|"We've tortured each other enough for tonight.
1462_170142_000046_000004.wav|The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
1462_170142_000013_000001.wav|She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
1462_170142_000026_000001.wav|"When did you first begin to feel like this, Bartley?"
1462_170142_000005_000001.wav|I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."
1462_170142_000042_000002.wav|Do you hear me, Bartley? It's too late.
1462_170142_000027_000001.wav|The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
1462_170142_000044_000006.wav|I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!"
1462_170142_000048_000002.wav|Forget everything except that I am here."
1462_170142_000031_000000.wav|She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
1462_170142_000043_000002.wav|I don't trust myself any more.
1462_170142_000022_000000.wav|At that word "deception," spoken with such self contempt, the color flashed back into Hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash.
1462_170142_000007_000000.wav|"There's something troubling you, Bartley.
1462_170142_000006_000000.wav|Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
1462_170142_000007_000001.wav|What is it?"
1462_170142_000029_000001.wav|"I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
1462_170142_000046_000007.wav|Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding-hard as a steel spring.
1462_170142_000002_000012.wav|But why do you let me chatter on like this?
1462_170142_000046_000003.wav|I must know about you.
1462_170142_000046_000001.wav|I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
1462_170142_000042_000008.wav|If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
1462_170142_000038_000003.wav|You've only to tell me now.
1462_170142_000044_000000.wav|Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
1462_170142_000021_000005.wav|There is this deception between me and everything."
1462_170142_000031_000002.wav|He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
1462_170142_000012_000000.wav|"Everything!"
1462_170142_000009_000000.wav|Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
1462_170142_000044_000003.wav|You ask me to stay away from you because you want me!
1462_170142_000008_000001.wav|"It's the whole thing that troubles me, Hilda.
1462_170142_000011_000000.wav|He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window.
1462_170142_000043_000003.wav|I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.
1462_170142_000042_000006.wav|But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
1462_170142_000001_000000.wav|The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.
1462_170142_000002_000001.wav|When Marie met him at the door, even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight.
1462_170142_000042_000005.wav|Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?
1462_170142_000035_000000.wav|She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:--
1462_170142_000002_000005.wav|Alexander did not sit down.
1462_170142_000015_000000.wav|"I can't live with myself any longer," he answered roughly.
1462_170142_000046_000000.wav|"Just something Bartley.
1462_170142_000037_000000.wav|Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
1462_170142_000006_000001.wav|Hilda watched him with perplexity.
1462_170142_000040_000001.wav|Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
1462_170142_000002_000013.wav|Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
1462_170142_000024_000001.wav|"It was myself I was defying, Hilda.
1462_170142_000043_000001.wav|"Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
1462_170142_000040_000004.wav|What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
1462_170142_000002_000011.wav|I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
1462_170142_000047_000001.wav|Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
1462_170142_000025_000000.wav|He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
1462_170142_000042_000004.wav|It's abominable of you to ask me.
1462_170142_000043_000005.wav|It's different now.
1462_170142_000042_000009.wav|Do you understand?
1462_170142_000002_000004.wav|A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
1462_170142_000016_000001.wav|He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
1462_170142_000028_000000.wav|Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
1462_170142_000030_000000.wav|"Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
1462_170142_000002_000010.wav|I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
1462_170142_000038_000001.wav|I was wrong.
1462_170142_000036_000000.wav|"You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.
1462_170142_000019_000001.wav|But it's worse now.
1462_170142_000025_000001.wav|He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
1462_170142_000004_000001.wav|You haven't spoken a word."
1462_170142_000041_000001.wav|She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
1462_170142_000033_000002.wav|At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
1462_170142_000024_000000.wav|He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
1462_170142_000043_000006.wav|I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
1462_170142_000040_000003.wav|I can't see you at all, anywhere.
1462_170142_000040_000002.wav|"It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
1462_170142_000041_000000.wav|Hilda sprang up like a flame.
1462_170142_000047_000000.wav|She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
1462_170142_000046_000008.wav|And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference."
1462_170142_000033_000001.wav|"Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
1462_170142_000026_000000.wav|She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.
1462_170142_000046_000006.wav|If I'd met you later, if I hadn't loved you so well-but that's all over, long ago.
1462_170142_000042_000003.wav|I won't promise.
1462_170142_000017_000000.wav|Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes.
1462_170142_000038_000004.wav|What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair.
1462_170142_000004_000000.wav|"When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen?
1462_170142_000001_000002.wav|He had planned to stop in Liverpool; but, instead, he took the boat train for London.
1462_170142_000031_000001.wav|Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
1462_170142_000043_000004.wav|It's getting the better of me.
1462_170142_000044_000005.wav|I will do anything you say-but that!
1462_170142_000023_000000.wav|"Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
1462_170142_000032_000002.wav|But afterward. . ."
1462_170142_000002_000008.wav|"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
1462_170142_000019_000000.wav|"Always.
1462_170142_000036_000002.wav|I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
1462_170142_000042_000001.wav|"It's too late to ask that.
1462_170142_000009_000001.wav|She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
1462_170142_000011_000001.wav|At last Alexander brought out one word:--
1462_170142_000048_000000.wav|"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
1462_170142_000021_000002.wav|"Each life spoils the other.
1462_170142_000021_000000.wav|He ignored her question.
1462_170142_000036_000003.wav|I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful-to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted."
1462_170142_000021_000003.wav|I get nothing but misery out of either.
1462_170142_000013_000000.wav|Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.
1462_170142_000029_000000.wav|Alexander groaned.
1462_170142_000033_000000.wav|"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
1462_170142_000002_000000.wav|Emerging at Euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square.
1462_170142_000021_000001.wav|"I am not a man who can live two lives," he went on feverishly.
1462_170142_000027_000000.wav|"After the very first.
1462_170142_000042_000007.wav|The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
1462_170138_000010_000003.wav|And what an audience!
1462_170138_000005_000003.wav|Myself, I always knew she had it in her.
1462_170138_000018_000000.wav|"I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she?"
1462_170138_000010_000002.wav|It's going famously to night, Mac.
1462_170138_000009_000001.wav|They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar.
1462_170138_000014_000000.wav|He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went.
1462_170138_000011_000000.wav|The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face.
1462_170138_000023_000011.wav|I shouldn't wonder- But they've probably spoiled her, so that she'd be tiresome if one met her again."
1462_170138_000022_000009.wav|You see, one can't be jealous about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal things,"--here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a quick, impulsive gesture-"oh, about those I should be very jealous.
1462_170138_000003_000006.wav|The ones who have any imagination do."
1462_170138_000010_000004.wav|You'll never do anything like this again, mark me.
1462_170138_000017_000000.wav|Mainhall cut in impatiently.
1462_170138_000005_000001.wav|"Then you can't have heard much at all, my dear Alexander.
1462_170138_000007_000003.wav|That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips-who ever heard it out of Galway?
1462_170138_000015_000007.wav|Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.
1462_170138_000005_000000.wav|Mainhall laughed.
1462_170138_000020_000000.wav|He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord Westmere, of course,--the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle.
1462_170138_000006_000002.wav|As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage.
1462_170138_000001_000006.wav|He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
1462_170138_000010_000000.wav|"MacConnell, let me introduce mr Bartley Alexander.
1462_170138_000011_000001.wav|"And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked.
1462_170138_000015_000000.wav|"Poor old Hugh," Mainhall murmured.
1462_170138_000022_000014.wav|You've made things come your way, and I never thought you'd do it.
1462_170138_000022_000001.wav|He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years; indeed, he had almost forgotten her.
1462_170138_000021_000002.wav|For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience.
1462_170138_000007_000005.wav|She's at her best in the second act.
1462_170138_000003_000005.wav|She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time.
1462_170138_000023_000005.wav|Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good.
1462_170138_000008_000003.wav|When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar.
1462_170138_000001_000007.wav|He hated them when they presumed to be anything else.
1462_170138_000012_000000.wav|"That's what I was saying," Mainhall lounged a little nearer and dropped into a tone even more conspicuously confidential.
1462_170138_000015_000009.wav|He's another who's awfully keen about her.
1462_170138_000023_000009.wav|It was youth and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly.
1462_170138_000023_000004.wav|Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all.
1462_170138_000012_000002.wav|Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn't possibly be better, you know."
1462_170138_000015_000001.wav|"He's hit terribly hard.
1462_170138_000023_000010.wav|I shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now.
1462_170138_000023_000008.wav|After all, we were awfully young.
1462_170138_000005_000002.wav|It's only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she's come up.
1462_170138_000015_000011.wav|Sir Harry Towne, mr Bartley Alexander, the American engineer."
1462_170138_000003_000004.wav|There's everything in seeing Hilda while she's fresh in a part.
1462_170138_000022_000004.wav|He felt guilty and unhappy about her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he really forgot Hilda altogether.
1462_170138_000019_000000.wav|Sir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously.
1462_170138_000010_000005.wav|A man writes to the top of his bent only once."
1462_170138_000022_000010.wav|I should torture myself-I couldn't help it." After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
1462_170138_000023_000003.wav|She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.
1462_170138_000015_000005.wav|One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe.
1462_170138_000008_000004.wav|After her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of Philly's burrow, where she sat singing "The Rising of the Moon" and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey.
1462_170138_000001_000004.wav|He spoke with an extreme Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music.
1462_170138_000021_000000.wav|When they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra was playing "The Cloak of Old Gaul." In a moment Peggy was on the stage again, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest.
1462_170138_000013_000000.wav|MacConnell grunted.
1462_170138_000021_000003.wav|In the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously, recalling with amusement Sir Harry's judicial frown.
1462_170138_000003_000001.wav|"It's tremendously well put on, too.
1462_170138_000015_000010.wav|Let me introduce you.
1462_170138_000022_000003.wav|Hilda had never replied to his letter.
1462_170138_000016_000000.wav|Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met mr Alexander and his wife in Tokyo.
1462_170138_000020_000001.wav|Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda."
1462_170138_000006_000003.wav|Miss Burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half door. "After all," he reflected, "there's small probability of her recognizing me.
1462_170138_000007_000001.wav|Of course, Hilda is Irish,--the Burgoynes have been stage people for generations,--and she has the Irish voice.
1462_170138_000007_000004.wav|She saves her hand, too.
1462_170138_000007_000000.wav|"You see," he murmured in Alexander's ear, as the curtain fell on the first act, "one almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness.
1462_170138_000004_000001.wav|"Why, I haven't heard of her for-years."
1462_170138_000022_000006.wav|After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man.
1462_170138_000015_000006.wav|I dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else." Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him.
1462_170138_000019_000002.wav|The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy, poor child.
1462_170138_000006_000000.wav|Just then they drove up to the Duke of York's, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre.
1462_170138_000022_000013.wav|"All the same," he lifted his glass, "here's to you, little Hilda.
1462_170138_000006_000001.wav|When they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland.
1462_170138_000019_000004.wav|A little attack of nerves, possibly."
1462_170138_000015_000008.wav|Here comes Sir Harry Towne.
1462_170138_000005_000004.wav|If we had one real critic in London-but what can one expect?
1462_170138_000007_000006.wav|She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale."
1462_170138_000022_000012.wav|He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her.
1462_170138_000005_000005.wav|Do you know, Alexander,"--Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,--"do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself.
1462_170138_000001_000005.wav|Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer.
1462_170138_000001_000001.wav|The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them.
1462_170138_000023_000002.wav|She hadn't much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles.
1462_170138_000010_000001.wav|I say!
1462_170138_000004_000000.wav|"Hilda Burgoyne!" Alexander exclaimed mildly.
1462_170138_000024_000000.wav|Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.
1462_170138_000015_000003.wav|She doesn't take up with anybody, you know.
1462_170138_000012_000001.wav|"And you'll never bring Hilda out like this again.
1462_170138_000006_000004.wav|She doubtless hasn't thought of me for years." He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell's irresistible comedy.
1462_170138_000023_000001.wav|But I never thought she'd do anything.
8297_275155_000006_000002.wav|"The charming widow!" Was it possible that this last word referred to Catherine?
8297_275155_000037_000000.wav|"Say thoroughly worthy of the course forced upon me and my daughter by your brother's infamous conduct-and you will be nearer the mark!"
8297_275155_000034_000001.wav|"And how did Catherine answer you?" he inquired.
8297_275155_000011_000001.wav|"There is my news," he said.
8297_275155_000045_000001.wav|That incorrigible old woman treated him with affectionate familiarity in return.
8297_275155_000036_000000.wav|"That will do, mrs Presty.
8297_275155_000045_000000.wav|He took leave of mrs Presty with the formality due to a stranger-he merely bowed.
8297_275155_000047_000001.wav|He stood, looking absently at the passengers leaving the carriage on the opposite side of the platform.
8297_275155_000025_000000.wav|"I should have told the truth."
8297_275155_000006_000000.wav|The allusion to Bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken.
8297_275155_000015_000000.wav|"You are to understand that Catherine is a widow.
8297_275155_000033_000000.wav|"Wait a minute," she answered.
8297_275155_000040_000000.wav|Randal asked if his friend was then at the hotel.
8297_275155_000023_000000.wav|"I should have kept in retirement for the future," he answered, "and not have trusted my child and myself among strangers in hotels."
8297_275155_000004_000001.wav|He read the paragraph in which it appeared.
8297_275155_000033_000002.wav|I said, 'Will you let Kitty see her father again?'"
8297_275155_000028_000003.wav|If I had told the truth at this hotel, when everybody wanted to know what mrs Norman, that handsome lady, was-what would the consequences have been to Catherine and her little girl?
8297_275155_000029_000000.wav|Randal decided on leaving her.
8297_275155_000024_000001.wav|And you would have condemned your poor little daughter to solitude?
8297_275155_000010_000003.wav|Out with it!"
8297_275155_000028_000000.wav|"Exactly what I did!
8297_275155_000031_000000.wav|"Does she submit to your telling Kitty that her father is dead?"
8297_275155_000008_000001.wav|She advanced to meet him, all smiles and amiability.
8297_275155_000022_000001.wav|"Would you have exposed yourself to be humiliated again in the same way?" she asked.
8297_275155_000027_000000.wav|"Yes."
8297_275155_000028_000001.wav|And the Captain of course concluded (after having been introduced to Kitty) that mrs Norman was a widow.
8297_275155_000002_000001.wav|Keep Your Temper.
8297_275155_000003_000005.wav|Randal bought it.
8297_275155_000003_000003.wav|As he took his place in the carriage, the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual.
8297_275155_000022_000000.wav|Having related the circumstances, she suggested that Randal should put himself in Catherine's place, before he ventured on expressing an opinion.
8297_275155_000046_000002.wav|Will it be of any use if we invite you to the marriage?"
8297_275155_000006_000001.wav|Randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph.
8297_275155_000043_000000.wav|"Where he is every day, about this time-out driving with Catherine and Kitty."
8297_275155_000008_000002.wav|"How nice of you to come so soon!" she began.
8297_275155_000005_000001.wav|It is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of Arctic fame; now better known, perhaps, as one of our leading philanthropists."
8297_275155_000024_000004.wav|He was introduced to mrs Norman, and to mrs Norman's little girl, and we were all charmed with him.
8297_275155_000032_000000.wav|For the first time mrs Presty became serious.
8297_275155_000020_000002.wav|"Is this woman mad?" he said to himself.
8297_275155_000036_000001.wav|Your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects."
8297_275155_000019_000000.wav|"Oh, don't talk of your brother!
8297_275155_000028_000006.wav|Vessel found bottom upward in the middle of the Atlantic, and everybody on board drowned, of course.
8297_275155_000028_000004.wav|No! no! I have made the best of a miserable situation; I have consulted the tranquillity of a cruelly injured woman and an innocent child-with this inevitable result; I have been obliged to treat your brother like a character in a novel.
8297_275155_000022_000002.wav|"And would you have seen your child made to suffer as well as yourself?"
8297_275155_000029_000001.wav|"Have you done all this with Catherine's consent?" he asked as he got up from his chair.
8297_275155_000008_000004.wav|"You don't mean to say that you are going to spoil our pleasant little dinner by bringing bad news!" she added, looking at him suspiciously.
8297_275155_000039_000000.wav|mrs Presty recovered all her audacity.
8297_275155_000046_000000.wav|"Good by, dear Randal.
8297_275155_000044_000000.wav|It was a relief to Randal-in the present state of Catherine's relations toward Bennydeck-to return to London without having seen his friend.
8297_275155_000002_000000.wav|Chapter forty.
8297_275155_000038_000001.wav|"Be so good," he said, "as to tell Catherine that I try to make every possible allowance for her, but that I cannot consent to sit at her dinner table, and that I dare not face my poor little niece, after what I have heard."
8297_275155_000021_000002.wav|I am put on my defense.
8297_275155_000003_000004.wav|The new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published.
8297_275155_000028_000005.wav|I have ship wrecked Herbert as the shortest way of answering inconvenient questions.
8297_275155_000047_000000.wav|Arrived at the station, Randal found that he must wait for the train. While he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about Sydney, the train from London came in.
8297_275155_000021_000001.wav|"If you are determined to make a serious business of it-if you insist on my justifying myself-you are to be pitied for not possessing a sense of humor, but you shall have your own way.
8297_275155_000028_000002.wav|If I had set him right, what would have become of my daughter's reputation?
8297_275155_000039_000002.wav|"Your sour face would spoil the best dinner that ever was put on the table.
8297_275155_000021_000004.wav|You shall hear how my divorced daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at Sandyseal, after you left us."
8297_275155_000024_000006.wav|If he had asked you about mr Norman, how would you have answered him?"
8297_275155_000024_000005.wav|When he and I happened to be left together he naturally wondered, after having seen the beautiful wife, where the lucky husband might be.
8297_275155_000041_000000.wav|mrs Presty smiled significantly.
8297_275155_000007_000001.wav|mrs Presty was at home; she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel.
8297_275155_000003_000001.wav|His prospects of success, in pleading for a favorable reception of his brother's message, were so uncertain that he refrained-in fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justify-from taking Herbert into his confidence.
8297_275155_000014_000000.wav|"Am I really to understand, mrs Presty, that Catherine-"
8297_275155_000016_000000.wav|"If this is one of your jokes, ma'am-"
8297_275155_000009_000000.wav|"It depends on you to decide that," Randal replied.
8297_275155_000021_000003.wav|Very well.
8297_275155_000013_000002.wav|The report is premature, my good friend.
8297_275155_000021_000000.wav|"Sit down," said mrs Presty.
8297_275155_000028_000007.wav|Worse stories have been printed; I do assure you, worse stories have been printed."
8297_275155_000033_000001.wav|"Before I consented to answer the child's inquiries, I came to an understanding with her mother.
8297_275155_000041_000001.wav|"Not at the hotel, just now."
8297_275155_000046_000001.wav|One moment before you go!
8297_275155_000035_000001.wav|She said: 'I daren't!' After that, I had her mother's authority for telling Kitty that she would never see her father again. She asked directly if her father was dead-"
8297_275155_000020_000000.wav|Randal drew back a step.
8297_275155_000015_000001.wav|I say it with pride, a widow of my making!"
8297_275155_000008_000000.wav|Randal found her comfortably established in a summerhouse, with her knitting in her hands, and a newspaper on her lap.
8297_275155_000013_000005.wav|The author only says, 'It's whispered.' How delicate of him!
8297_275155_000030_000000.wav|"Catherine submits to circumstances, like a sensible woman."
8297_275155_000013_000006.wav|What a perfect gentleman!"
8297_275155_000024_000002.wav|You would have seen her pining for the company of other children, and would have had no mercy on her?
8297_275155_000035_000000.wav|"Honestly.
8297_275155_000024_000000.wav|"Ah, indeed?
8297_275155_000006_000004.wav|With his own suspicions steadily contradicting him, he arrived at the hotel, obstinately believing that "the charming widow" would prove to be a stranger.
8297_275155_000020_000001.wav|mrs Presty's audacity was something more than he could understand.
8297_275155_000004_000000.wav|After reading one or two of the political articles, he arrived at the columns specially devoted to "Fashionable Intelligence." Caring nothing for that sort of news, he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles, when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye.
8297_275155_000034_000000.wav|The very question which Randal had promised to ask in his brother's interests!
8297_275155_000010_000000.wav|"How very complimentary to a poor useless old woman!
8297_275155_000018_000000.wav|"Are you aware, mrs Presty, that my brother-"
8297_275155_000008_000003.wav|Her keen penetration discovered something in his face which checked the gayety of her welcome.
8297_275155_000019_000001.wav|He's an obstacle in our way, and we have been compelled to get rid of him."
8297_275155_000013_000000.wav|"I am indeed sorry to spoil your dramatic effect," she said.
8297_275155_000013_000004.wav|Besides, if it isn't true now, it will be true next week.
8297_275155_000039_000001.wav|"A very wise decision," she remarked.
8297_275155_000010_000001.wav|Don't be mysterious, my dear.
8297_275155_000039_000003.wav|Have you any message for Captain Bennydeck?"
8297_275155_000042_000000.wav|"Where is he?"
8297_275155_000011_000000.wav|Randal handed his paper to her, open at the right place.
8297_275155_000038_000000.wav|Randal passed this over without notice.
8297_275155_000003_000002.wav|No one knew on what errand he was bent, when he left the house.
8297_275156_000017_000007.wav|In any event, her second marriage would lead to one disastrous result.
8297_275156_000016_000000.wav|"Leave that to me," was the one reply which Randal could venture to make at the moment.
8297_275156_000019_000000.wav|He had promised to do his best toward persuading Catherine to grant Sydney an interview.
8297_275156_000002_000002.wav|"You have been to the hotel?" he burst out; "you have seen Catherine?"
8297_275156_000013_000005.wav|No more of it now.
8297_275156_000020_000000.wav|Even this apparently simple proceeding required examination in its different bearings, before he could begin his letter.
8297_275156_000008_000001.wav|It was not the newspaper which he had bought at the station.
8297_275156_000011_000000.wav|"After what you have told me, why should I suppose anything of the sort?"
8297_275156_000017_000003.wav|If he made the disclosure on their return to the house, he would be only running the same risk of consequences, after an interval of delay; and, if he remained silent, the march of events might, at any moment, lead to the discovery of what he had concealed.
8297_275156_000023_000004.wav|I don't doubt that I am free already to do this; but it will encourage the poor girl, if I can speak with your authority."
8297_275156_000017_000001.wav|His natural frank nature urged him to undeceive Herbert.
8297_275156_000026_000001.wav|His opinion of this correspondent was expressed in prompt action-he threw the letter, unopened, into the waste paper basket.
8297_275156_000000_000001.wav|Make the Best of It.
8297_275156_000007_000001.wav|"Malcolm meant well, poor fellow," he said, referring to the old servant, "but he made a miserable man of me for all that."
8297_275156_000022_000000.wav|Written under the modifying influence of these conclusions, his letter contained the few words that follow:
8297_275156_000018_000000.wav|If Randal shrank from the prospect which thus presented itself to him, in his relations with his brother, and if his thoughts reverted to Sydney Westerfield, other reasons for apprehension found their way into his mind.
8297_275156_000017_000008.wav|It would sooner or later come to Herbert's ears.
8297_275156_000017_000004.wav|Add to this, that his confidence in Catherine had been rudely shaken.
8297_275156_000017_000000.wav|The serious embarrassments that surrounded him were thickening fast.
8297_275156_000003_000003.wav|We have both seen the same newspaper, of course-and you have been the first to clear the thing up.
8297_275156_000027_000000.wav|The next letter was from Bennydeck, written in the kindest terms, but containing no allusion to any contemplated change in his life.
8297_275156_000013_000000.wav|Herbert became more unreasonable than ever.
8297_275156_000017_000009.wav|In the meantime, after what mrs Presty had confessed, the cruel falsehood which had checked poor Kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child.
8297_275156_000006_000000.wav|"She's not Catherine, at any rate; I, for one, shall go home with a lighter heart." He took his brother's arm, to return to the other platform.
8297_275156_000023_000003.wav|Shall I say that she may expect an early visit from you, when I see her to morrow?
8297_275156_000008_000000.wav|Not satisfied with gossip in private, the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print, and wants more of it than any one editor can supply. Randal picked up the torn newspaper.
8297_275156_000021_000004.wav|What happier future could await her-especially if she justified Randal's past experience of all that was candid and truthful in her character-than to become his friend's wife?
8297_275156_000003_000000.wav|Randal could deny that he had seen Catherine, with perfect truth-and did deny it in the plainest terms.
8297_275156_000019_000002.wav|Under the exasperating influence of a disappointment for which she was not prepared, it was hard to say what act of imprudence Sydney might not commit.
8297_275156_000006_000002.wav|The devil take the thing, and the people who write in it!"
8297_275156_000007_000000.wav|He snatched a newspaper out of his pocket as he spoke-tore it in half-and threw it away.
8297_275156_000025_000000.wav|On the afternoon of the next day two letters were delivered to Randal, bearing the Sydenham postmark.
8297_275156_000021_000000.wav|Would he be justified in alluding to the report which associated Bennydeck with Catherine?
8297_275156_000024_000000.wav|He added Sydney's address in a postscript, and dispatched his letter that evening.
8297_275156_000026_000000.wav|The first which he happened to take up was addressed to him in mrs Presty's handwriting.
8297_275156_000013_000003.wav|The bare doubt that my divorced wife might be the woman was bad enough-but what I wanted to find out was how she had passed off her false pretense on our child.
8297_275156_000013_000006.wav|Have you seen Catherine lately?"
8297_275156_000021_000003.wav|Besides, looking to Catherine's interest-and not forgetting how she had suffered-had Randal any right to regard with other than friendly feelings a second marriage, which united her to a man morally and intellectually the superior of her first husband?
8297_275156_000009_000002.wav|If it had driven me out of mind, I shouldn't have been surprised."
8297_275156_000001_000000.wav|For a moment the two men looked at each other without speaking. Herbert's wondering eyes accurately reflected his brother's astonishment.
8297_275156_000021_000001.wav|Considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty, even with an intimate friend.
8297_275156_000014_000000.wav|"Not lately."
8297_275156_000013_000001.wav|"If Catherine does think of marrying again," he said, "the man will have to reckon first with me. But that is not the point.
8297_275156_000019_000006.wav|Be the results, however, what they might, Randal could see but one plain course before him now.
8297_275156_000010_000000.wav|"Gently, Herbert!
8297_275156_000021_000002.wav|It was for the Captain to confirm what mrs Presty had said of him, if he thought it desirable to touch on the subject in his reply.
8297_275156_000002_000000.wav|"What are you doing here?" he asked.
8297_275156_000015_000000.wav|"I suppose she is as handsome as ever.
8297_275156_000027_000002.wav|No explanation of the cause of this delay followed.
8297_275156_000009_000001.wav|It drove me out of the house and into the railway.
8297_275156_000015_000001.wav|When will you ask her to let me see Kitty?"
8297_275156_000019_000005.wav|But that she would receive the same unremitting attention, while he was courting Catherine, which would have been offered to her under other circumstances, was not to be hoped.
8297_275156_000017_000006.wav|Randal's loyalty to Catherine hesitated to decide that serious question against the woman whom he had known, trusted, and admired for so many years.
8297_275156_000017_000002.wav|If he followed his inclinations, in the near neighborhood of the hotel, who could say what disasters might not ensue, in his brother's present frame of mind?
8297_275156_000003_000004.wav|That's it, isn't it?"
8297_275156_000003_000001.wav|Herbert was satisfied.
8297_275156_000006_000001.wav|"Do you know, Randal, I was almost afraid that Catherine was the woman.
8297_275156_000017_000005.wav|Having allowed herself to be entrapped into the deception proposed by her mother, and having thus far persevered in that deception, were the chances in favor of her revealing her true position-especially if she was disposed to encourage Bennydeck's suit?
8297_275156_000008_000002.wav|Herbert had been reading a rival journal, devoted to the interests of Society-in which the report of mrs Norman's marriage was repeated, with this difference, that it boldly alluded to Captain Bennydeck by name.
8297_275156_000023_000002.wav|Without entering into particulars which may be mercifully dismissed from notice, let me only assure you that I answer for Sydney Westerfield as being worthy of the fatherly interest which you feel in her.
8297_275156_000008_000003.wav|"Did Malcolm give you this?" Randal asked.
8297_275156_000019_000001.wav|To perform that promise appeared to be now simply impossible.
8297_275156_000013_000002.wav|You seem to have forgotten that the woman at Buck's Hotel is described as a Widow.
8297_275156_000019_000007.wav|He decided on hastening Sydney's introduction to Bennydeck, and on writing at once to prepare the Captain for that event.
8297_275156_000023_000001.wav|Your old friend's daughter has abandoned her sinful way of life, and has made sacrifices which prove the sincerity of her repentance.
8297_275156_000023_000000.wav|"I have news for you which I am sure you will be glad to hear.
8297_275156_000012_000000.wav|"Don't be angry; and do pray remember that the Divorce allows you and Catherine to marry again, if you like."
8297_275156_000027_000001.wav|He would not be able (he wrote) to leave Sydenham for a day or two.
8297_275156_000002_000001.wav|Suspicion overclouded his face as he put the question.
8297_275156_000019_000004.wav|That the Captain would welcome his friend's daughter as affectionately as if she had been his own child, was not to be doubted for a moment.
8297_275156_000010_000001.wav|Supposing the report had been true-?"
8297_275156_000003_000002.wav|"In all my remembrance of you," he said, "you have never told me a lie.
8297_275156_000027_000003.wav|But it might, perhaps, be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on, and that the Captain's proposals were still waiting for Catherine's reply.
8297_275154_000036_000001.wav|"You will stay here with me; and if I happen to be away, there will be somebody in the house, who is almost as fond of you as I am." He mentioned the name of one of the old servants at Mount Morven, who had attached himself to Randal after the breakup of the family.
8297_275154_000003_000002.wav|The sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port-with no other explanation than that the cruise was over.
8297_275154_000024_000007.wav|I didn't know how fond I was of Sydney till I lost her; I didn't know how fond I was of my wife till I left her." He paused, and put his hand to his fevered head.
8297_275154_000023_000000.wav|He laid his head wearily on the back of his chair.
8297_275154_000036_000002.wav|"And now rest," he said, "and let me put this cushion under your head."
8297_275154_000016_000000.wav|"Give me her address.
8297_275154_000008_000000.wav|Was this man-haggard, pallid, shabby, looking at him piteously with bloodshot eyes-the handsome, pleasant, prosperous brother whom he remembered?
8297_275154_000035_000001.wav|No, no; of course you won't forget." He tried to rise, and fell back again into his chair.
8297_275154_000006_000001.wav|In spite of the appearance of innocence which pervaded Catherine's letter, the true motive for breaking off his cruise might be found, as Randal concluded, in Catherine herself.
8297_275154_000001_000002.wav|On the chance of getting the information that he wanted, Randal wrote to the hotel at Sandyseal.
8297_275154_000011_000000.wav|"Give me a glass of wine.
8297_275154_000034_000000.wav|"Yes-as soon as possible."
8297_275154_000002_000000.wav|The landlord's reply a little surprised him.
8297_275154_000035_000000.wav|"And you won't forget?
8297_275154_000004_000001.wav|Her letter concluded in these words: "You will only meet one person besides ourselves-your friend, and (since we last met) our friend too.
8297_275154_000030_000000.wav|Herbert lifted his head, and laid his hand earnestly on his brother's arm.
8297_275154_000008_000004.wav|And yet he spoke roughly; he looked like an angry man brought to bay.
8297_275154_000014_000000.wav|He put down the empty glass, taking no notice of his brother's question. "Randal," he said, "you know where Sydney is."
8297_275154_000037_000000.wav|Herbert answered: "It's like being at home again"--and composed himself to rest.
8297_275154_000024_000005.wav|Shake hands, Randal; we have never had any unfriendly words; we mustn't begin now.
8297_275154_000006_000000.wav|To represent Bennydeck as being "tired of the sea," and as being willing to try, in place of the breezy Channel, the air of a suburb of London, was to make excuses too perfectly futile and absurd to deceive any one who knew the Captain.
8297_275154_000008_000002.wav|He could only point to a seat.
8297_275154_000032_000002.wav|"She shall have your message; all that I can do to persuade her shall be done."
8297_275154_000022_000011.wav|Give me back Sydney, or knock out my brains.
8297_275154_000022_000009.wav|Alone!
8297_275154_000028_000001.wav|Will you give her a message?"
8297_275154_000012_000001.wav|Whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him, it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner.
8297_275154_000024_000006.wav|There's something perverse about me.
8297_275154_000007_000001.wav|After months of separation, he received a visit from Herbert.
8297_275154_000035_000003.wav|I'm not fit company for you, I know; I'll go when you tell me."
8297_275154_000006_000005.wav|Randal wrote to accept the invitation; determining to present himself before the appointed hour, and to question Catherine privately, without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview.
8297_275154_000022_000006.wav|And, now, Sydney's taken away from me next.
8297_275154_000024_000011.wav|Tell me where my wife is living now?"
8297_275154_000019_000002.wav|Miss Westerfield is quite right in separating herself from you.
8297_275154_000019_000001.wav|Go back to your chair; fierce looks and clinched fists don't frighten me.
8297_275154_000020_000000.wav|He spoke sternly-with his heart aching for his brother all the time. He was right.
8297_275154_000006_000002.wav|Her residence at the sea side, helped by the lapse of time, had restored to her personal attractions almost all they had lost under the deteriorating influences of care and grief; and her change of name must have protected her from a discovery of the Divorce which would have shocked a man so sincerely religious as Bennydeck.
8297_275154_000011_000001.wav|I've been walking-I don't know where.
8297_275154_000024_000004.wav|It eases my head when I rest like this.
8297_275154_000022_000013.wav|Oh, why did I engage that governess!
8297_275154_000030_000001.wav|When he said his next words he was almost like his old self again.
8297_275154_000019_000000.wav|"I will do neither the one nor the other.
8297_275154_000032_000001.wav|"I feel for you, Herbert," he said, warmly.
8297_275154_000015_000000.wav|Randal admitted it.
8297_275154_000022_000014.wav|I was so happy, Randal, with Catherine and little Kitty."
8297_275154_000001_000000.wav|Not having heard from Captain Bennydeck for some little time, Randal thought it desirable in Sydney's interests to make inquiries at his club.
8297_275154_000032_000000.wav|His tone touched Randal to the quick.
8297_275154_000006_000003.wav|Had her beauty fascinated him?
8297_275154_000007_000000.wav|In the short time that passed before the day of the dinner, distressing circumstances strengthened his resolution.
8297_275154_000006_000004.wav|Was she aware of the interest that he felt in her? and was it secretly understood and returned?
8297_275154_000021_000000.wav|The poor wretch sank under Randal's firm voice and steady eye.
8297_275154_000024_000010.wav|"Dear old fellow, I want you to do me a favor.
8297_275154_000011_000002.wav|A long distance; I'm dead beat."
8297_275154_000027_000000.wav|"You can't do it."
8297_275154_000022_000004.wav|You don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature, always nicely dressed, always about the room-thinking so much of you, and so little of herself-and then to be left alone as I am left, out in the dark.
8297_275154_000020_000001.wav|The one way is the positive way, when a man who suffers trouble is degraded by it.
8297_275154_000024_000003.wav|No! I'm not faint.
8297_275154_000001_000001.wav|Nothing was known of the Captain's movements there.
8297_275154_000033_000000.wav|"As soon as possible?"
8297_275154_000019_000006.wav|And, once again, sit down."
8297_275154_000022_000005.wav|I haven't got my wife; she has thrown me over, and taken my child away from me.
8297_275154_000022_000007.wav|I'm alone.
8297_275154_000018_000000.wav|"You won't write it?
8297_275154_000003_000004.wav|He called at his friend's private residence, only to hear from the servants that they had seen nothing of their master.
8297_275154_000003_000001.wav|Captain Bennydeck had landed, to all appearance in fairly good health; and had left by an early train for London.
8297_275154_000016_000001.wav|My mind's in such a state I can't remember it; write it down."
8297_275154_000022_000002.wav|I'm not like you; I'm not accustomed to live alone.
8297_275154_000022_000000.wav|"Don't be hard on me," he said.
8297_275154_000019_000005.wav|Try to understand them.
8297_275154_000005_000000.wav|These lines set Randal thinking seriously.
8297_275154_000036_000000.wav|Randal refused to let him go at all.
8297_275154_000022_000008.wav|Do you hear that?
8297_275154_000000_000001.wav|Listen to Reason.
8297_275154_000024_000002.wav|I tried it yesterday; it set my brains on fire; I'm feeling that glass I took just now.
8297_275154_000026_000001.wav|I have something to say to her."
8297_275154_000012_000002.wav|In a man morally weak, calamity (suffered without resisting power) breaks its way through the surface which exhibits a gentleman, and shows the naked nature which claims kindred with our ancestor the savage.
8297_275154_000024_000009.wav|He astonished his brother by a new entreaty-the last imaginable entreaty that Randal expected to hear.
8297_275154_000019_000003.wav|And you are quite wrong in wishing to go back to her.
8297_275154_000010_000000.wav|"You distress me, Herbert, more than words can say."
8297_275154_000009_000000.wav|"I seem to frighten you," he said.
8297_275154_000035_000002.wav|"Let me rest a little," he pleaded, "if I'm not in the way.
8297_275154_000022_000012.wav|I haven't courage enough to do it for myself.
8297_275154_000012_000000.wav|He drank the wine greedily.
8297_275154_000003_000000.wav|Some days since, the yacht had again appeared in the bay.
8297_275154_000029_000000.wav|"Let me hear what it is first."
8297_275154_000024_000008.wav|Was his mind wandering into some other train of thought?
8297_275154_000018_000001.wav|and you won't give it?"
8297_275154_000022_000001.wav|"I think a man in my situation is to be pitied-especially by his brother.
8297_275154_000004_000002.wav|Captain Bennydeck has got tired of the sea.
8297_275154_000003_000003.wav|This alternative in the Captain's plans (terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated) puzzled Randal.

5694_64029_000010_000000.wav|His pistol was leveled, and I was ordered to march.
5694_64029_000025_000000.wav|By this time our command had re-formed, and charged the blazing crest.
5694_64029_000013_000013.wav|I remember that they had to cross an open field in our front, and we were lying behind a fence, and as they advanced, we kept up firing, and would run them back every time, until they brought up a regiment that whooped, and yelled, and charged our skirmish line, and then we fell back again.
5694_64029_000006_000000.wav|I had orders to allow no one to pass.
5694_64029_000006_000001.wav|In fact, no one was expected to pass at this point, but while standing at my post, a horseman rode up behind me.
5694_64029_000022_000001.wav|They fell back and re-formed.
5694_64029_000028_000004.wav|I looked at it pretty close, and I said "Great God!" for I could see his heart throb, and the respiration of his lungs. I was filled with wonder and horror at the sight.

5694_64029_000005_000003.wav|I was on picket at the time the advance was made by Rosecrans.
5694_64029_000030_000000.wav|In passing over the battlefield, I came across a dead Yankee colonel. He had on the finest clothes I ever saw, a red sash and fine sword. I particularly noticed his boots.
5694_64029_000028_000002.wav|His face was as white as a sheet.
5694_64029_000016_000009.wav|We marched plumb into the Yankee lines, with their flags flying.
5694_64029_000006_000002.wav|I halted him, and told him to go down to the main picket on the road and pass, but he seemed so smiling that I thought he knew me, or had a good joke to tell me.
5694_64029_000013_000002.wav|My gun was at my feet, and one step would get it.
5694_64029_000002_000000.wav|We came from Knoxville to Chattanooga, and seemed destined to make a permanent stay here.
5694_64029_000030_000003.wav|I took hold of the foot and raised it up and made one trial at the boot to get it off.
5694_64029_000028_000001.wav|I do not know to what regiment he belonged, but I remember of first noticing that his left arm was entirely gone.

5694_64029_000013_000000.wav|I soon found out that he had caught sight of the relief on the road, and was afraid to shoot.
5694_64029_000022_000004.wav|General Cheatham, all the time, was calling on the men to go forward, saying, "Come on, boys, and follow me."
5694_64029_000017_000000.wav|I called Lieutenant Colonel Frierson's attention to the Yankees, and he remarked, "Well, I don't know whether they are Yankees or not, but if they are, they will come out of there mighty quick."

5694_64029_000013_000007.wav|Major Allen, of the Twenty seventh Tennessee Regiment, took the saddle and bridle, and gave me the blanket.
5694_64029_000008_000001.wav|I was perfectly willing to let the spy go on his way rejoicing-for such he was-but he wanted to capture a Rebel.
5694_64029_000016_000004.wav|It was said to be buckeye whisky.
5694_64029_000018_000000.wav|The Yankees marched over the hill out of sight.
5694_64029_000028_000003.wav|The breast and sleeve of his coat had been torn away, and I could see the frazzled end of his shirt sleeve, which appeared to be sucked into the wound.
5694_64029_000005_000004.wav|At the time mentioned, I was standing about two hundred yards off the road, the main body of the pickets being on the Nashville and Murfreesboro turnpike, and commanded by Lieutenant Hardy Murfree, of the Rutherford Rifles.
5694_64029_000019_000001.wav|We were right upon the Yankee line on the Wilkerson turnpike.
5694_64029_000016_000000.wav|It was Christmas.
5694_64029_000031_000002.wav|Our pickets had run in and reported a night attack.
5694_64029_000009_000001.wav|There I was, a prisoner sure, and no mistake about it.
5694_64029_000019_000003.wav|A universal cry was raised, "You are firing on your own men." "Cease firing, cease firing," I hallooed; in fact, the whole skirmish line hallooed, and kept on telling them that they were Yankees, and to shoot; but the order was to cease firing, you are firing on your own men.
5694_64029_000013_000005.wav|The ball missed its aim.
5694_64029_000011_000004.wav|Is it a bargain?"
5694_64029_000016_000003.wav|They couldn't see straight.
5694_64029_000006_000007.wav|I dropped the gun.
5694_64029_000010_000001.wav|I was afraid to halloo to the relief, and you may be sure I was in a bad fix.
5694_64029_000027_000002.wav|I thought it had been torn from my shoulder.

5694_64029_000013_000004.wav|He divined my motive, and fired.
5694_64029_000013_000006.wav|He put spurs to his horse, but I pulled down on him, and almost tore the fore shoulder of his horse entirely off, but I did not capture the spy, though I captured the horse, bridle and saddle.
5694_64029_000011_000001.wav|I think you are a soldier; you look like a gentleman.

5694_64029_000030_000002.wav|But I could not bear the thought of wearing dead men's shoes.
5694_64029_000016_000002.wav|Our generals, and colonels, and captains, had kissed john a little too often.
5694_64029_000009_000000.wav|And I had made up my mind to think likewise.
5694_64029_000011_000003.wav|You go your way, and leave me here.
5694_64029_000016_000007.wav|But here they were-the Yankees-a battle had to be fought. We were ordered forward.
5694_64029_000005_000002.wav|From time to time different regiments were sent forward to do picket duty.
5694_64029_000030_000004.wav|I happened to look up, and the colonel had his eyes wide open, and seemed to be looking at me.
5694_64029_000022_000000.wav|The crest occupied by the Yankees was belching loud with fire and smoke, and the Rebels were falling like leaves of autumn in a hurricane. The leaden hail storm swept them off the field.

Love's cheat yields joy and profit.

8842_302201_000006_000001.wav|But albeit I spake not to her again, yet it behoved me afterward to write of another matter, more noble than the foregoing.
8842_302201_000007_000005.wav|But when I still spake not, one of them, who before had been talking with another, addressed me by my name, saying, "To what end lovest thou this lady, seeing that thou canst not support her presence?
8842_302201_000014_000002.wav|The second is the matter treated of.
8842_302201_000014_000009.wav|The second begins here, "And I declare;" the third here, "Wherefore I will not speak;" the fourth here, "With you alone." Then, when I say "An Angel," I begin treating of this lady: and this part is divided into two.
8842_302201_000014_000001.wav|The first part is a proem to the words following.
8842_302201_000008_000003.wav|Whereupon I declare that my tongue spake as though by its own impulse, and said, "Ladies that have intelligence in love." These words I laid up in my mind with great gladness, conceiving to take them as my commencement.
8842_302201_000007_000000.wav|Through the sore change in mine aspect, the secret of my heart was now understood of many.
8842_302201_000014_000010.wav|In the first, I tell what is understood of her in heaven.
8842_302201_000014_000005.wav|In the first, I say to whom I mean to speak of my lady, and wherefore I will so speak.
8842_302201_000007_000002.wav|And as I was going that way by chance, (but I think rather by the will of fortune,) I heard one of them call unto me, and she that called was a lady of very sweet speech.
8842_302201_000014_000004.wav|The second begins here, "An Angel;" the third here, "Dear Song, I know." The first part is divided into four.
8842_302201_000014_000007.wav|In the third, I say what it is I purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness.
8842_302201_000014_000014.wav|Then, when I say, "Dear Song, I know," I add a stanza as it were handmaid to the others, wherein I say what I desire from this my poem.
8842_302201_000003_000000.wav|Thereafter, this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four other things touching my condition, the which things it seemed to me that I had not yet made manifest.
8842_302201_000008_000005.wav|The poem begins here:--
8842_302201_000006_000002.wav|And for that the occasion of what I then wrote may be found pleasant in the hearing, I will relate it as briefly as I may.
8842_302201_000003_000002.wav|And I said these four things in a sonnet, which is this:--
8842_302201_000008_000000.wav|Then I, being almost put to shame because of her answer, went out from among them; and as I walked, I said within myself: "Seeing that there is so much beatitude in those words which do praise my lady, wherefore hath my speech of her been different?" And then I resolved that thenceforward I would choose for the theme of my writings only the praise of this most gracious being.
8842_302201_000014_000003.wav|The third is, as it were, a handmaid to the preceding words.
8842_302201_000007_000003.wav|And when I had come close up with them, and perceived that they had not among them mine excellent lady, I was reassured; and saluted them, asking of their pleasure.
8842_302203_000001_000000.wav|A few days after this, my body became afflicted with a painful infirmity, whereby I suffered bitter anguish for many days, which at last brought me unto such weakness that I could no longer move.
8842_302203_000003_000001.wav|Whereby other ladies, who were about the room, becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made, (who indeed was of my very near kindred,) led her away from where I was, and then set themselves to awaken me, thinking that I dreamed, and saying: "Sleep no longer, and be not disquieted."
8842_302203_000010_000002.wav|Just then you woke me, of your complaisaunce."
8842_302203_000001_000001.wav|And I remember that on the ninth day, being overcome with intolerable pain, a thought came into my mind concerning my lady: but when it had a little nourished this thought, my mind returned to its brooding over mine enfeebled body.
8842_302203_000011_000002.wav|In the second, I say how I told them.
8842_302203_000011_000001.wav|In the first, speaking to a person undefined, I tell how I was aroused from a vain phantasy by certain ladies, and how I promised them to tell what it was.
8842_302203_000013_000000.wav|A short while after these words which my heart spoke to me with the tongue of Love, I saw coming towards me a certain lady who was very famous for her beauty, and of whom that friend whom I have already called the first among my friends had long been enamoured.
8842_302203_000020_000002.wav|The third tells how, after he had in such wise been with me a space, I saw and heard certain things.
8842_302203_000011_000005.wav|In the second, I tell what these ladies said to me after I had left off this wandering: and it begins here, "But uttered in a voice." Then, when I say, "I was a thinking," I say how I told them this my imagination; and concerning this I have two parts.
8842_302203_000010_000001.wav|I do so desire to see thy face That I am like as one who nears the tomb; My soul entreats thee, Come.' Then I departed, having made my moan; And when I was alone I said, and cast my eyes to the High Place: 'Blessed is he, fair soul, who meets thy glance!' ...
8842_302203_000011_000006.wav|In the first, I tell, in order, this imagination.
8842_302203_000003_000000.wav|And as I said these words, with a painful anguish of sobbing and another prayer unto Death, a young and gentle lady, who had been standing beside me where I lay, conceiving that I wept and cried out because of the pain of mine infirmity, was taken with trembling and began to shed tears.
8842_302203_000002_000008.wav|And so strong was my phantasy, that I wept again in very truth, and said with my true voice: "O excellent soul! how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee!"
8842_302203_000002_000005.wav|Then my heart that was so full of love said unto me: "It is true that our lady lieth dead;" and it seemed to me that I went to look upon the body wherein that blessed and most noble spirit had had its abiding place.
8842_302203_000004_000004.wav|Whereof I wrote this poem:--
8842_302203_000020_000003.wav|The second part begins here, "Saying, 'Be now;'" the third here, "Then, while it was his pleasure." The third part divides into two.
8842_302203_000012_000000.wav|After this empty imagining, it happened on a day, as I sat thoughtful, that I was taken with such a strong trembling at the heart, that it could not have been otherwise in the presence of my lady.
8842_302203_000010_000000.wav|"And I became so humble in my grief, Seeing in her such deep humility, That I said: 'Death, I hold thee passing good Henceforth, and a most gentle sweet relief, Since my dear love has chosen to dwell with thee: Pity, not hate, is thine, well understood. Lo!
8842_302203_000004_000003.wav|Also, after I had recovered from my sickness, I bethought me to write these things in rhyme; deeming it a lovely thing to be known.
8842_302203_000002_000003.wav|She that was thine excellent lady hath been taken out of life." Then I began to weep very piteously; and not only in mine imagination, but with mine eyes, which were wet with tears.
8842_302203_000011_000003.wav|The second part begins here, "I was a thinking." The first part divides into two.
8842_302203_000002_000007.wav|Wherefore come now unto me who do greatly desire thee: seest thou not that I wear thy colour already?" And when I had seen all those offices performed that are fitting to be done unto the dead, it seemed to me that I went back unto mine own chamber, and looked up towards Heaven.
8842_302203_000020_000001.wav|The second says how it appeared to me that Love spake within my heart, and what was his aspect.
8842_302196_000014_000006.wav|The task of the translator (and with all humility be it spoken) is one of some self denial.

6313_76958_000097_000000.wav|"We will now get to work on the herd," announced the foreman.
6313_76958_000040_000000.wav|"Breakfast?" jeered Lumpy.
6313_76958_000028_000000.wav|In floundering about, making up his bunk, the lad had fallen over two cowboys and stepped full on the face of a third.
6313_76958_000089_000000.wav|"Pong, tell the young gentlemen what would become of you if you were to serve bad meals to this outfit of cowpunchers."
6313_76958_000010_000000.wav|"Better not try it out on the range," smiled the foreman.
6313_76958_000034_000000.wav|The guard chanced to be Lumpy Bates, and he administered, what to him, was a gentle kick, to hurry the boy along.
6313_76958_000056_000001.wav|The boss said the first man he heard using language while you tenderfeet were with us, would get fired on the spot."
6313_76958_000007_000000.wav|Off on the plain they heard a rich tenor voice raised in the song of the cowman.
6313_76958_000022_000000.wav|The cowboy did this very thing, but within an hour he found himself alone, the others having turned in one by one.
6313_76958_000006_000000.wav|"It's the 'Cowboy's Lament,'" laughed Bob Stallings.
6313_76958_000009_000000.wav|"I don't call that much of a song," sniffed Chunky contemptuously after a moment of silence on the part of the group.

6313_76958_000047_000000.wav|"Hi, there!" hissed Lumpy, filled with indignation that anyone should attempt to mount a pony from the right side.
6313_76958_000036_000002.wav|There'll be a lively muss about the time you do, I reckon, and you'll wish you hadn't.
6313_76958_000077_000000.wav|"Who is the wrangler this morning?" asked the foreman, glancing about at his men.
6313_76958_000020_000003.wav|You can enjoy yourselves sleeping just as well as sitting up."
6313_76958_000084_000000.wav|"I think you will find them all there, Master Tad, if you will consult the big book," said the Professor.
6313_76958_000045_000000.wav|Lumpy Bates came running toward him, not daring to call out for fear of waking the camp.
6313_76958_000064_000000.wav|Out on the plains the fourth guard were drowsily crooning the lullaby about the bull that "came down the hillside, long time ago."
6313_76958_000030_000000.wav|This effectually quieted the boy for the night, and the camp settled down to silence and to sleep.
6313_76958_000006_000001.wav|"Listen."
6313_76958_000045_000002.wav|Chunky, however, was too sleepy to see anything so small as a cowman swinging his arms a rod away.
6313_76958_000067_000000.wav|Almost before the echoes of his voice had died away, a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon.
6313_76958_000054_000000.wav|"Does it make any difference?"
6313_76958_000074_000000.wav|"Fine," chorused the boys.
6313_76958_000037_000000.wav|"What do you want?" demanded the boy.
6313_76958_000061_000000.wav|"Where are they?" asked the boy.
6313_76958_000085_000000.wav|The meal was soon finished, Pong having stood rubbing his palms, a happy smile on his face, during the time they were eating.
6313_76958_000008_000000.wav|"Little black bull came down the hillside, Down the hillside, down the hillside, Little black bull came down the hillside, Long time ago."
6313_76958_000073_000001.wav|"Those fellows have to go out.
6313_76958_000060_000001.wav|"The cows'll sleep themselves out of sight before you get there, if you don't get a move on."
6313_76958_000073_000000.wav|"You boys don't have to swallow your food whole," smiled the foreman, observing that the Pony Riders seemed to think they were expected to hurry through their meal as well.
6313_76958_000052_000000.wav|He shook the lad violently.
6313_76958_000027_000000.wav|Stacy Brown proved the only grumbler in the lot, declaring that he could not sleep a wink on such a bed as that.
6313_76958_000014_000000.wav|"When you get to be half as good a man on cows as your friend the Pinto, here, you'll be a full grown man," added Big foot.
6313_76958_000038_000000.wav|"It's your trick.
6313_76958_000029_000000.wav|Instantly there was a chorus of yells and snarls from the disturbed cowpunchers, accompanied by dire threats as to what they would do to the gopher did he ever disturb their rest in that way again.
6313_76958_000082_000000.wav|"Oh, no, this kind of a wrangler isn't," laughed the foreman.
6313_76958_000021_000002.wav|That's the way I'm going to do it, to night."
6313_76958_000051_000001.wav|"Don't you know any more than to try to get onto a broncho from the off side?
6313_76958_000040_000001.wav|"You're lucky to be alive in this outfit, let alone filling yourself with grub.
6313_76958_000093_000000.wav|Pong, going through the motions of drawing a gun from his belt, and puffing out his cheeks, uttered an explosive "pouf!"
6313_76958_000033_000000.wav|Stacy grumbled, turned over and went to sleep again.
6313_76958_000073_000003.wav|The fourth guard has to eat yet, so there is plenty of time. How did you all sleep?"
6313_76958_000082_000002.wav|The horse wrangler is the fellow who goes out and rounds up the ponies.
6313_76958_000014_000001.wav|"The Pinto rounded up a bunch of stray cows to night as well as I could do it myself, and he didn't go about it with a brass band either."
6313_76958_000066_000001.wav|Roll out!" he roared, bringing the sleepy cowpunchers grumbling to their feet.
6313_76958_000049_000000.wav|Stacy shot up into the air as if he had been propelled from a bow gun. He struck the soft sand several feet in advance of the pony, his face and head ploughing a little furrow as he drove along on his nose.
6313_76958_000032_000002.wav|With Stacy Brown, however, severe measures were necessary when one of the returning guard routed him out at half past three in the morning.
6313_76958_000079_000000.wav|"Wrangler?
6313_76958_000017_000000.wav|"The pony did most of it," admitted the lad.
6313_76958_000094_000000.wav|"Oh, you mean they would shoot you?" asked Walter.
6313_76958_000036_000000.wav|"Keep still, you baby!" growled the cowman.
6313_76958_000019_000000.wav|Walter had gone out with the second guard, and the others had gathered around the camp fire for their nightly story telling.
6313_76958_000002_000000.wav|THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
6313_76958_000080_000000.wav|"A wrangler's a wrangler," answered Big foot stolidly.
6313_76958_000020_000002.wav|We've got a hard drive before us, and every man must be fit as a fiddle.
6313_76958_000041_000000.wav|Stacy ruefully, and still half asleep, made a wide circle around the sleeping cowmen that he might not make the mistake of again stepping on any of them.
6313_76958_000015_000000.wav|The foreman nodded, with an approving glance at Tad.
6313_76958_000020_000000.wav|"Now, I don't want you fellows sitting up all night," objected the foreman.
6313_76958_000032_000000.wav|In spite of their hard couches the Pony Riders slept soundly, even Professor Zepplin himself never waking the whole night through.
6313_76958_000048_000000.wav|His warning came too late.
6313_76958_000086_000000.wav|"A very fine breakfast, sir," announced the Professor, looking up at the Chinaman.
6313_76958_000001_000000.wav|CHAPTER four
6313_76958_000059_000000.wav|The rest of the fourth guard had already gone out, Chunky meeting the returning members of the third coming in.
6313_76958_000031_000002.wav|Besides holding the untrustworthy horses, it afforded a temporary corral for catching a change of mounts.
6313_76958_000038_000003.wav|I wouldn't have saddled it but the boss said I must.
6313_76958_000043_000000.wav|The lad caught the pony that stood moping in the corral, not appearing to be aware that his rider was preparing him for the range, Chunky all the time muttering to himself.
6313_76958_000018_000000.wav|"More than most tenderfeet would have done," growled Big foot.
6313_76958_000012_000000.wav|"Bob thinks it might stampede the herd," spoke up Big foot Sanders.
6313_76958_000026_000001.wav|These they spread out on the ground, using boots wrapped in coats for pillows.
6313_76958_000081_000000.wav|"He's a fellow who's all the time making trouble, isn't he?" asked Stacy innocently.
6313_76958_000038_000001.wav|Get a move on you and keep still.
6313_76958_000090_000000.wav|The Chinaman showed two rows of white teeth in his expansive grin.
6313_76958_000073_000002.wav|Take your time.
6313_76958_000082_000004.wav|He's a trouble curer, not a troublemaker, except for himself."
6313_76958_000091_000000.wav|"Allee same likee this," he explained.
6313_76958_000096_000000.wav|"I guess we are pretty sure of having real food to eat, then," laughed Tad, as the boys rose from the table ready for the active work of the day.
6313_76958_000078_000000.wav|"I am," spoke up Shorty Savage promptly.
6313_76958_000038_000002.wav|There's the pony ready for you.
6313_76958_000063_000000.wav|In a few moments they, too, had turned their ponies adrift and had thrown themselves down beside their companions, pulling their blankets well about them, for the night had grown chill.
6313_76958_000036_000005.wav|You won't be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that, I reckon."
6313_76958_000076_000001.wav|It is astonishing with how little a man can get along when he has to."
6313_76958_000023_000000.wav|"Where are your beds?" asked Stacy after the foreman had urged the boys to get to sleep.
6313_76958_000048_000001.wav|Stacy Brown's left leg swung over the saddle. No sooner had the pony felt the leather over him than he raised his back straight up, his head going down almost to the ground.
6313_76958_000011_000001.wav|Why not?" demanded the boy.
6313_76958_000017_000001.wav|"I just gave him his head, and that's all there was to it."
6313_76958_000024_000001.wav|"Anywhere-everywhere.
6313_76958_000036_000004.wav|If you make a racket there, Pong will dump a pot of boiling water over you.
6313_76958_000024_000000.wav|"Beds?" grunted Big foot.
6313_76958_000065_000000.wav|It seemed as if scarcely a minute had passed since the boys turned in before they were awakened by the strident tones of the foreman.
6313_76958_000069_000000.wav|It was the Chinaman, Pong, sounding his call for breakfast, in accordance with the usage of the plains.
6313_76958_000079_000001.wav|What's a wrangler?" demanded Stacy, delaying the progress of a large slice of bacon, which hung suspended from the fork half-way between plate and mouth.
6313_76958_000020_000001.wav|"None of you will be fit for duty to morrow.
6313_76958_000036_000001.wav|"Do you want to wake up the whole outfit?
6313_76958_000013_000000.wav|A loud laugh followed at Chunky's expense.
6313_76958_000016_000000.wav|Tad's eyes were sparkling from the experiences of the evening, as well as from the praise bestowed upon him by the big cowpuncher.
6313_76958_000024_000002.wav|Our beds, on the plains, are wherever we happen to pull our boots off."
6313_76958_000088_000000.wav|"What do you mean?" asked Ned Rector.
6313_76958_000094_000001.wav|"I hardly think they would do that, Pong."
6313_76958_000036_000003.wav|If you can't keep shut, the boss'll be for making you sleep under the chuck wagon.
6313_76958_000058_000000.wav|At first the pony began to buck; then, evidently thinking the effort was not worth while, settled down to a rough trot which soon shook the boy up and thoroughly awakened him.
6313_76958_000071_000000.wav|By the time the cowmen and Pony Riders had refreshed themselves at the spring near which the outfit had camped, a steaming hot breakfast had been spread on the ground, with a slicker for a table cloth.
6313_76958_000045_000001.wav|The cowman was swinging his arms and seeking to attract the lad's attention.
6313_76958_000097_000001.wav|"We had better start the drive this morning.
6313_76958_000042_000000.wav|Lumpy watched him with disapproving eyes.
6313_76958_000060_000000.wav|"Better hurry up, kid," they chuckled.
6313_76958_000039_000000.wav|"Is breakfast ready?" asked the boy, tightening his belt and jamming his sombrero down over his head.
6313_76958_000004_000000.wav|In a few moments the sound of singing was borne to the ears of the campers.
6313_76958_000051_000002.wav|Say, don't you?"
6313_66129_000022_000000.wav|"Found a bee tree on my way back, and cut it down.
6313_66129_000057_000001.wav|"Suppose we start with a race?
6313_66129_000074_000002.wav|I can do that myself," he grunted.
6313_66129_000023_000000.wav|"We'll take all chances," advised Ned.
6313_66129_000027_000002.wav|I think I shall help myself to some of that wild plum jam and biscuit, first It reminds me of old times.
6313_66129_000060_000001.wav|This time the battle lay between Tad Butler and Ned Rector.
6313_66129_000055_000000.wav|They assured him that nothing was further from their intention, and quickly casting aside guns and cartridge belts, they threw themselves into their saddles again for a jolly romp.
6313_66129_000079_000002.wav|Let me have that hat, Tad," he demanded as the latter came trotting up to the group.
6313_66129_000049_000000.wav|The guide said that, by making a detour in their journey that day, they would cross table lands several acres in extent and covered with grass.
6313_66129_000011_000000.wav|"Not enough to give us indigestion," answered Ned.
6313_66129_000092_000001.wav|Fortunately, his right foot freed itself from the stirrup at the same time, or there might have been a different ending.
6313_66129_000005_000000.wav|The boys awaited the guide's approach with impatience, some pacing back and forth, while others coaxed the fire into a roaring blaze, at the same time confiding to each other how hungry they were.
6313_66129_000036_000002.wav|I offer you my humble apologies.
6313_66129_000083_000001.wav|I couldn't get it," explained Chunky.
6313_66129_000044_000000.wav|"What I want to know, is, when do we go hunting?" asked Ned.
6313_66129_000058_000000.wav|To this all agreed.
6313_66129_000065_000000.wav|By this time, the boys had come to feel fully as much at home in the saddle as they formerly had been out of it.
6313_66129_000019_000000.wav|Chunky reached the table first, greedily surveying what had been placed on it.
6313_66129_000023_000002.wav|It looks like jam."
6313_66129_000016_000001.wav|"I don't need guns to hunt with.
6313_66129_000038_000003.wav|I came near losing my life too, and----"
6313_66129_000033_000000.wav|"Remember, sir, that a certain amount of dignity befits the office of president of the Pony Riders Club," he said.
6313_66129_000031_000000.wav|Chunky did even better than that.
6313_66129_000051_000000.wav|The boys were now all anxiety to start, while the ponies, after their Sunday rest, were almost as full of life as were their owners.
6313_66129_000027_000003.wav|We sometimes had jam when I was with the German----"
6313_66129_000040_000002.wav|Besides this, there are many abandoned mines up the range further.
6313_66129_000046_000000.wav|"I think I'll ride my own pony and let the dog walk," announced Ned.
6313_66129_000088_000000.wav|"Be careful, Chunky," warned Walter.
6313_66129_000057_000003.wav|We'll do it three times, and the one who wins two times out of three will be it."
6313_66129_000064_000000.wav|The third heat was merely a repetition of the second.
6313_66129_000071_000001.wav|Grasping the pommel with the left hand, he appeared to dive head first toward the ground.
6313_66129_000065_000001.wav|Even Stacy Brown, though he did not sit his saddle with the same grace that marked the riding of Tad Butler and Ned Rector, more practiced horsemen, was nevertheless no mean rider.
6313_66129_000093_000000.wav|"Are you hurt?" asked Tad apprehensively.
6313_66129_000078_000001.wav|"If you haven't I would advise you to go easy.
6313_66129_000013_000001.wav|It must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out," laughed Tad.
6313_66129_000068_000000.wav|"I'll show you," promised Tad.
6313_66129_000060_000000.wav|The next two heats were different.
6313_66129_000012_000000.wav|"But I left you a rabbit.
6313_66129_000052_000001.wav|A temporary camp was quickly pitched.
6313_66129_000004_000002.wav|He no doubt would bring food of some kind with him.
6313_66129_000064_000002.wav|Ned took his defeat good naturedly.
6313_66129_000016_000000.wav|"You'll see when you get to camp," answered Chunky.
6313_66129_000056_000000.wav|The great, green field, surrounded on all sides by tall trees, made the place an ideal one for their purpose.
6313_66129_000034_000000.wav|Chunky colored.
6313_66129_000063_000000.wav|Texas seemed to leap clear of the ground, planting himself on all fours just over the line, the winner by a neck.
6313_66129_000002_000000.wav|ROUGH RIDERS IN THE SADDLE
6313_66129_000028_000000.wav|"Army," added Ned.
6313_66129_000016_000002.wav|A stout club for mine."
6313_66129_000014_000000.wav|"And we've got a surprise for you," announced Stacy, swelling with pride.
6313_66129_000023_000001.wav|"But what's this!
6313_66129_000089_000000.wav|"He's got to learn," declared Tad.
6313_66129_000045_000005.wav|But this dog, you will find, is a wonder.
6313_66129_000036_000001.wav|"I'd lose my dignity for a mouthful of that, any day," he decided after having sampled the combination. "President Brown, I withdraw my criticism.
6313_66129_000079_000000.wav|"Don't you worry about me, Ned Rector.
6313_66129_000009_000000.wav|With a shout, the boys dashed pell mell to meet the pack train, and, falling in behind the slow moving burros, urged them on with derisive shouts and sundry resounding slaps on the animals' flanks.
6313_66129_000092_000002.wav|Chunky turned a double somersault, lay still for a moment, then struggled up, rubbing his body gingerly, as the rest of the party came hurrying up to him.
6313_66129_000021_000001.wav|Why, mr Thomas, where did you get honey?" asked Walter.
6313_66129_000080_000000.wav|Stacy, his face flushed, determination plainly showing in his eyes, stretched forth his hand for the sombrero.
6313_66129_000042_000000.wav|"All you want.
6313_66129_000074_000003.wav|"I've seen them do that in the wild west shows too many times not to know how myself."
6313_66129_000059_000001.wav|Walter Perkins won the heat.
6313_66129_000008_000000.wav|"Now you may go," he nodded.
6313_66129_000077_000000.wav|"I will," replied Chunky, confidently.
6313_66129_000047_000000.wav|Supper having been finished, the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chat, after which, admonishing Stacy to keep within his tent and not to go borrowing trouble, the boys turned in for a sound sleep.
6313_66129_000037_000001.wav|"Are there bears up here?"
6313_66129_000045_000002.wav|We shall need a dog.
6313_66129_000038_000001.wav|"We are in the bear country now.
6313_66129_000036_000004.wav|Next thing we know you'll be providing us with bear steak."
6313_66129_000043_000000.wav|This announcement filled the boys with excitement.
6313_66129_000078_000000.wav|"Got your life insured?" asked Ned.
6313_66129_000048_000000.wav|As yet, they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies, owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying.
6313_66129_000081_000000.wav|Stacy dismounted and removed the hat carefully to one side.
6313_66129_000060_000002.wav|It was a beautiful race, the little Indian ponies seeming to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest, stretching themselves out to their full lengths, and, with heads on a level with their backs, fairly flew across the great plot of green.
6313_66129_000076_000000.wav|"Why not show us, then?" he said.
6313_66129_000092_000000.wav|As a result, instead of stopping when he reached the hat, the boy kept on going.
6313_66129_000085_000001.wav|You don't have to move the hat, you ninny."
6313_66129_000090_000000.wav|Then Chunky essayed the feat.
6313_66129_000018_000000.wav|By the time the meal was ready the tents had been pitched and the boys had returned from the spring, rubbing their faces with their coarse towels, their cheeks glowing and their eyes sparkling in anticipation of the feast.
6313_66129_000045_000003.wav|But I know an old settler who will lend us his dog, if it is not out.
6313_66129_000036_000000.wav|"Then, I think I'll try some myself," announced Ned, helping himself liberally to the honey and jam.
6313_66129_000051_000001.wav|The little animals were becoming more sure footed every day, and Ned said that, before the trip was finished, "Jimmie" would be able to walk a slack rope.
6313_66129_000045_000001.wav|Perhaps Tuesday.

6313_66129_000021_000000.wav|"Honey?
6313_66129_000069_000000.wav|Galloping into camp the boy fetched his sombrero, which he carried well out into the field and tossed away.
6313_66129_000004_000003.wav|The fire would be ready and thus no time would be lost in preparing the first meal of the day, which, in this case, would be breakfast, dinner and supper all in one.
6313_66129_000071_000000.wav|All at once he dropped to the saddle and slipped the left foot from the stirrup.
6313_66129_000020_000002.wav|What do you think of that?"
6313_66129_000027_000000.wav|"Now, fall to, young gentlemen," directed the Professor.
6313_66129_000052_000000.wav|An early start was made, so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten o'clock in the forenoon.
6313_66129_000013_000000.wav|"We did not.
6313_66129_000011_000001.wav|"Cold water is the most nourishing thing we've touched since last night."
6313_66129_000062_000000.wav|Tad hitched in his saddle a little, throwing the greater part of his weight on the stirrups.
6313_66129_000010_000000.wav|"Had anything to eat!" asked the guide.
6313_66129_000054_000001.wav|"I guess I had better go along to see that you do not."
6313_66129_000061_000000.wav|Up to within a moment of the finish of the second heat the two ponies were racing neck and neck.
6313_66129_000027_000001.wav|"I am free to admit that I am hungry, too.
6313_66129_000020_000000.wav|"Hooray, fellows!" he shouted.
6313_66129_000085_000000.wav|"Why don't you move the pony?
6313_66129_000064_000001.wav|All agreed that Tad's superior horsemanship, alone, had won the race for him.
6313_66129_000079_000001.wav|Guess I know how to ride.
6313_66129_000038_000000.wav|"I reckon there are," smiled the guide.
6313_66129_000045_000000.wav|"That depends.
6313_66129_000050_000002.wav|The trail is so plainly marked that he can't miss it."
6313_66129_000012_000001.wav|Didn't you find it?"
6313_66129_000075_000000.wav|Walter smiled, with a twinkle in his eyes.
6313_66129_000091_000000.wav|At the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup, he threw his body sharply to the right, reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel.
6313_66129_000040_000000.wav|"Yes, the country is full of caves.
6313_66129_000080_000001.wav|Riding bravely out into the field, he tossed it to the ground.
6313_66129_000031_000001.wav|He buried his biscuit under a layer of jam, over which he spread a thick coating of honey.
6313_66129_000053_000000.wav|At their urgent request, Professor Zepplin told the boys to go ahead and enjoy themselves.
6313_66129_000057_000002.wav|We'll race the length of the field and back.
6313_66129_000025_000000.wav|"Yes; wild plum jam," answered the guide.
6313_66129_000035_000000.wav|"It's good, anyway."
6313_66129_000045_000004.wav|Of course, dogs can't follow the trail of an animal as well, now, as they could with snow on the ground.
6313_66129_000007_000000.wav|It was a gladsome sound to this band of hungry boys, whose ordinarily healthy appetites, under the bracing mountain air and the long fast, had taken on what the Professor described as a "razor edge."
6313_66129_000062_000001.wav|He slapped Texas sharply on the flank with the flat of his hand.
6313_66129_000032_000000.wav|Ned fixed him with a stern eye.
6313_66129_000039_000000.wav|"A cave?" interrupted Tad.
6313_66125_000059_000000.wav|"Right!" announced the guide in a reassuring voice.
6313_66125_000058_000000.wav|It was a trying moment for all of them, and naturally more so for the boy who was about to descend into the unknown depths of the mountain canyou.
6313_66125_000068_000002.wav|Will it be all right for me to swing myself?"
6313_66125_000090_000001.wav|Closing his eyes, he clung to the slender support with grim courage until a hail from above told him that the rawhide loop was rapidly squirming down toward him.
6313_66125_000044_000002.wav|I'll go down, mr Thomas."
6313_66125_000019_000006.wav|We'll have you out of that in no time."
6313_66125_000070_000001.wav|But he doesn't answer me."
6313_66125_000057_000001.wav|After winding the end tightly about his own arm, he handed a lighted torch to Tad.
6313_66125_000051_000008.wav|"Here, put my gun in your pocket."
6313_66125_000023_000001.wav|"It's a tough job.
6313_66125_000011_000002.wav|Walt's alive!
6313_66125_000022_000000.wav|"Now, what are we going to do, I'd like to know?" asked Ned.
6313_66125_000016_000000.wav|"Looks like a clump of bushes down there.
6313_66125_000070_000000.wav|"Lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree, I think it is.
6313_66125_000082_000001.wav|Tell them Walt's all right.
6313_66125_000071_000000.wav|"Wait a minute," cautioned the mountaineer.
6313_66125_000025_000000.wav|"Yes, that's the only way we can do it.
6313_66125_000064_000000.wav|"Hold a torch over the edge of the cliff, Master Ned," directed the guide.
6313_66125_000020_000002.wav|"Are you hurt?"
6313_66125_000076_000001.wav|But from the cautious movements of the light far below them, the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability.
6313_66125_000005_000001.wav|Keep back!" he shouted, as the boys and Professor Zepplin began crowding near the masked edge of the cliff.
6313_66125_000076_000000.wav|Then followed a long period of suspense.
6313_66125_000078_000002.wav|The boy's doing the best he can.
6313_66125_000043_000000.wav|"Let me go, mr Thomas," interrupted Ned Rector, stepping forward, with almost a challenge in his eyes.
6313_66125_000038_000002.wav|Something else besides saying you're going to will be necessary."
6313_66125_000082_000002.wav|He can talk now," was the answer that carried with it such a note of gladness that Ned and Stacy were unable to resist a shout of joy.
6313_66125_000032_000001.wav|They gazed at each other in perplexity.
6313_66125_000005_000000.wav|"Keep back!
6313_66125_000007_000003.wav|I'm going back for a torch," he commanded, leaping by them on his way to the camp fire.
6313_66125_000051_000005.wav|If you find the support too weak to bear your weight, let me know.
6313_66125_000078_000001.wav|Don't bother him.
6313_66125_000047_000000.wav|"I protest!" shouted the Professor.
6313_66125_000021_000000.wav|To this question Walter made some reply that was unintelligible to them.
6313_66125_000017_000001.wav|All I can see is rocks and shadows.
6313_66125_000044_000001.wav|"I am the one to go after Walt, if anyone has to.
6313_66125_000054_000000.wav|"Yes."
6313_66125_000028_000001.wav|Let me know when the rope reaches you.
6313_66125_000036_000001.wav|He ain't very strong, you know.
6313_66125_000042_000000.wav|"In that case, you will have to go yourself, Thomas," decided the Professor sharply.
6313_66125_000013_000000.wav|"Is it possible!
6313_66125_000019_000002.wav|Hey, Walter!
6313_66125_000025_000001.wav|Run over to the cook tent and tell Jose to give you those rawhide lariats that he will find behind his bunk.
6313_66125_000002_000001.wav|Running to the edge of the cliff, he leaned over and listened intently.
6313_66125_000011_000003.wav|But I don't know how we are going to get him."
6313_66125_000040_000000.wav|"One of us must go down there," was the guide's startling announcement.
6313_66125_000046_000000.wav|"And he most certainly will," interrupted Tad, advancing a step.
6313_66125_000051_000007.wav|Be sure to fasten him securely to the loop before you give the signal to haul up," warned the guide.
6313_66125_000062_000000.wav|He tilted his head to look up.
6313_66125_000016_000001.wav|But I ain't sure.
6313_66125_000017_000002.wav|Where is it that you think you see bushes?"
6313_66125_000090_000000.wav|The boy could not repress a shudder.
6313_66125_000083_000001.wav|"Are you all safe down there, Tad?"
6313_66125_000037_000000.wav|"Then what are we going to do?
6313_66125_000048_000001.wav|"You'd have both of us at the bottom if I left it to you to take care of this end."
6313_66125_000064_000001.wav|"Better lie down so you, too, don't take a notion to fall off.
6313_66125_000020_000000.wav|"Don't move around.
6313_66125_000020_000001.wav|Lie perfectly still," warned the guide.
6313_66125_000017_000000.wav|"no
6313_66125_000061_000001.wav|As he did so, Tad felt himself gradually sinking into the sombre depths.
6313_66125_000065_000001.wav|After what seemed to them hours, a sharp call from the depths reached their ears.
6313_66125_000007_000000.wav|"It's Master Walt," snapped the guide.
6313_66125_000062_000001.wav|The movement sent his body swaying giddily from side to side.
6313_66125_000034_000005.wav|I don't dare try any experiments."
6313_66125_000045_000000.wav|"Master Tad is right," decided the guide, gazing at the two boys approvingly.
6313_66125_000007_000002.wav|Don't move an inch.
6313_66125_000027_000000.wav|The mountaineer quickly formed a loop in one end of the rope, making it large enough to permit of its slipping over the shoulders of a man.
6313_66125_000029_000000.wav|There was no response.
6313_66125_000010_000000.wav|"I know-I know-but----"
6313_66125_000036_000003.wav|Ain't no use to expect him to hook himself onto the line, even if he does wake up," decided the guide with emphasis, beginning to haul up the lariat, which he coiled neatly on the rock in front of him.
6313_66125_000085_000000.wav|Very slowly, restraining their inclination to haul the rope in with all speed only because the warning eyes of the guide were upon them, the two boys, assisted by Professor Zepplin, began hoisting Walter Perkins toward the top.
6313_66125_000051_000000.wav|"Now, be very careful.
6313_66125_000061_000000.wav|"Good!" approved Lige encouragingly, beginning to let the rawhide slip slowly around the trunk of the tree.
6313_66125_000038_000000.wav|"Right you are, young man.
6313_66125_000036_000000.wav|"Fainted, probably.
6313_66125_000064_000002.wav|Keep your eyes shut till I tell you to open them."
6313_66125_000018_000000.wav|"Over there to the right, just near the edge of the light space made by the torch light," answered the guide.
6313_66125_000063_000000.wav|Cautiously placing a hand against the rocks to steady himself, Tad wisely concluded that hereafter it would not pay to be too curious.
6313_66125_000084_000000.wav|"Sure thing!" answered the boy.
6313_66125_000051_000002.wav|And, if you meet with anything unlooked for, let me know at once.
6313_66125_000038_000001.wav|But talking won't do it.
6313_66125_000028_000002.wav|Can you slip it over your shoulders and under your arms?" called the guide.
6313_66125_000073_000001.wav|Now try it."
6313_66125_000016_000002.wav|Can you make it out?"
6313_66125_000006_000000.wav|"What is it?" demanded the Professor breathlessly.
6313_66125_000050_000000.wav|The guide, without further delay, and giving no heed to Professor Zepplin's nervous protests, slipped the noose over Tad's shoulders, and, drawing it down and up under his arms, secured the knot so that the loop might not tighten under the weight of the boy's body.
6313_66125_000025_000002.wav|Hurry!"
6313_66125_000033_000000.wav|"Has-he---gone?" asked the Professor weakly.
6313_66125_000074_000000.wav|The creaking of the rawhide told them that Tad Butler was swaying from side to side, fifty feet below them, at the end of a slender line.
6313_66125_000036_000002.wav|And that tumble's enough to knock the sense out of a full grown man.
6313_66125_000073_000000.wav|"All right.
6313_66125_000053_000000.wav|"Are you ready?"
6313_66125_000045_000001.wav|"It will be better for him to go, if he will----"
6313_66125_000012_000000.wav|The shout of joy that had framed itself on the lips of Ned Rector and Stacy Brown died out in an indistinct murmur.
6313_66125_000015_000000.wav|"See anything?" asked Tad tremulously, creeping to his side.
6313_66125_000078_000000.wav|"Keep still!
6313_66125_000069_000000.wav|"Where is he?"
6313_66125_000019_000000.wav|"Yes," agreed Tad, "that does look like bushes.
6313_66125_000035_000000.wav|"What do you think has happened to him?" asked Tad in a troubled voice.
6313_66125_000068_000001.wav|"He's so far to the right of me that I can't reach him.
6313_66125_000034_000003.wav|But I don't dare try it.
6313_66125_000067_000001.wav|Got him?" he answered, leaning over the cliff.
6313_66125_000019_000005.wav|Stick tight and don't get scared.
6313_66125_000087_000000.wav|Walter had fully regained consciousness by this time, and a brief examination showed that he had sustained no serious injury, he having struck on the yielding branches of the pinyon, which broke his fall and saved his life.
6313_66125_000048_000000.wav|"I am needed right here, sir," replied the guide, shortly.
6313_66125_000051_000006.wav|I'll send down another rope to which you can tie yourself until we get Master Walter to the top.
6313_66125_000082_000000.wav|"Yes; haul away.
6313_66125_000008_000000.wav|"Where-is-he?" stammered the Professor, not observing that the guide had left them.
6313_66125_000019_000004.wav|"All right, old man.
6313_66125_000007_000001.wav|"Stand still.
6313_66125_000024_000000.wav|"Why not get a rope and let it down to him," suggested Tad.
6313_66125_000013_000001.wav|What are we going to do, Thomas-how are we to rescue the boy?"
6313_66125_000005_000002.wav|"You'll all be over if you don't have a care.
6313_66125_000003_000000.wav|A moment more and he too caught the plaintive cry for help from below.
6313_66125_000067_000000.wav|"Yes?
6313_66125_000051_000004.wav|But, before removing the rope from your own body, make sure that you are safe.
6313_66125_000001_000000.wav|A DARING RESCUE
6313_66125_000028_000000.wav|"Hello, down there!
6313_66125_000039_000000.wav|"What would you suggest!"
6313_66125_000011_000000.wav|"I heard him call.
6313_66125_000052_000000.wav|"I understand."
6313_66125_000009_000000.wav|"Down there, sir," explained Tad, pointing to the ledge of rock over which Walter had fallen.
6313_66125_000068_000000.wav|"I see him," called Tad, his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above.
6313_66125_000047_000002.wav|You are----"
6313_66125_000037_000001.wav|We've got to get Walt up here, even if I have to jump over after him," said Tad firmly.
84_121550_000187_000000.wav|And as my countenance was lifted up, Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;
84_121550_000234_000000.wav|Even as a painter who from model paints I would portray how I was lulled asleep; He may, who well can picture drowsihood.
84_121550_000225_000000.wav|Its tresses, which so much the more dilate As higher they ascend, had been by Indians Among their forests marvelled at for height.
84_121550_000084_000000.wav|So that it overhead remained distinct With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.
84_121550_000147_000000.wav|Therefore my answer is with greater care, That he may hear me who is weeping yonder, So that the sin and dole be of one measure.
84_121550_000034_000000.wav|Some apprehension keeps you marvelling; But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.
84_121550_000083_000000.wav|And I beheld the flamelets onward go, Leaving behind themselves the air depicted, And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,
84_121550_000153_000000.wav|As soon as ever of my second age I was upon the threshold and changed life, Himself from me he took and gave to others.
84_121550_000031_000000.wav|Apart three paces did the river make us; But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across, (A curb still to all human arrogance,)
84_121550_000029_000000.wav|I do not think there shone so great a light Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed By her own son, beyond his usual custom!
84_121550_000192_000000.wav|Then, when the heart restored my outward sense, The lady I had found alone, above me I saw, and she was saying, "Hold me, hold me."
84_121550_000115_000000.wav|And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned, Singing, "Veni, sponsa, de Libano" Shouted three times, and all the others after.
84_121550_000303_000000.wav|The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge, Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black, The Alp upon its frigid border wears.
84_121550_000162_000000.wav|"O thou who art beyond the sacred river," Turning to me the point of her discourse, That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,
84_121550_000195_000000.wav|The beautiful lady opened wide her arms, Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath, Where I was forced to swallow of the water.
84_121550_000217_000000.wav|I saw upon its right wing wheeled about The glorious host returning with the sun And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.
84_121550_000136_000000.wav|"Look at me well; in sooth I'm Beatrice! How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain? Didst thou not know that man is happy here?"

84_121123_000056_000005.wav|Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few words thanked the district doctor, he turned to d'Avrigny, and said,--"And now the priest."
84_121123_000066_000000.wav|"It is a young girl."
84_121123_000012_000007.wav|Take a last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own, and then separate yourself from her forever.
84_121123_000042_000000.wav|"Yes."
84_121123_000044_000000.wav|"Yes."
84_121123_000029_000000.wav|"Do you wish me to leave?" said Morrel, sadly.
84_121123_000052_000000.wav|"Yes," replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.
84_121123_000019_000000.wav|"Sir," said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion,--"sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes here.
84_121123_000056_000002.wav|He therefore approached the bed, and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face, which looked like that of a sleeping angel.
84_121123_000011_000007.wav|Tell them-oh, tell them, that corpse belongs to me!"
84_121123_000022_000002.wav|"Yes, yes," continued Morrel; "recall the scene, for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.
84_121123_000017_000000.wav|"Gentlemen," said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene, "I know what I am saying, and you know as well as I do what I am about to say-Valentine has been assassinated!" Villefort hung his head, d'Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said "Yes" with his eyes.
84_121123_000045_000000.wav|"Oh," said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone,--"oh, be satisfied, I can understand my father." D'Avrigny took the young man's arm, and led him out of the room.
84_121123_000011_000000.wav|"Sir," cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, "they ask me who I am, and what right I have to be here.
84_121123_000049_000000.wav|"Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done," said Villefort.
84_121123_000011_000003.wav|One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.
84_121123_000049_000002.wav|Do you not, father?"
84_121123_000007_000001.wav|Maximilian.
84_121123_000021_000000.wav|"Oh, you rave, sir," exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken.
84_121123_000062_000006.wav|D'Avrigny accosted the priest.
84_121123_000054_000000.wav|It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair of Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks.
84_121123_000067_000000.wav|"I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me.
84_121123_000054_000006.wav|The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the lips.
84_121123_000049_000001.wav|"My father has revealed the culprit's name; my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this secret.
84_121123_000043_000000.wav|"But can he understand you?"
84_121123_000028_000000.wav|"And will you direct us?" exclaimed the young man.
84_121123_000062_000004.wav|As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door.
84_121123_000055_000000.wav|"Alas," said d'Avrigny, "she is indeed dead, poor child!"
84_121123_000019_000001.wav|I am stricken by fate.
84_121123_000009_000008.wav|"See, my father, see!"
84_121123_000053_000001.wav|We have before stated that all the servants had fled.
84_121123_000020_000004.wav|I tell you that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has succeeded.
84_121123_000009_000007.wav|"See what they have done!" cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the back of the chair, and the other extended towards Valentine.
84_121123_000038_000000.wav|"no"
84_121123_000015_000000.wav|"I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office."
84_121123_000030_000000.wav|"Yes," replied Noirtier.
84_121123_000037_000001.wav|The procureur?"
84_121123_000050_000003.wav|Is it not so, father?"
84_121123_000062_000001.wav|You will excuse me, will you not?
84_121123_000062_000007.wav|"Sir," he said, "are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter?
84_121123_000024_000002.wav|Noirtier wishes to speak."
84_121123_000039_000000.wav|"The doctor?"
84_121123_000061_000000.wav|"Do you wish to see him?"
84_121123_000046_000000.wav|"Gentlemen," he said in a hoarse voice, "give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves!" The two men drew back.
84_121123_000069_000000.wav|"I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine." D'Avrigny took the priest's hand, and without meeting Villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine's room, which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers.
84_121123_000068_000000.wav|"Thank you, sir," said d'Avrigny; "since you have commenced your sacred office, deign to continue it.
84_121123_000054_000005.wav|Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent as the corpse.
84_121123_000057_000000.wav|"Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?" asked d'Avrigny.
84_121123_000017_000002.wav|mr Procureur," said Morrel with increasing vehemence, "no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is your place to seek the assassin." The young man's implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his side, glanced from Noirtier to d'Avrigny.
84_121123_000027_000000.wav|"Yes," replied Noirtier.
84_121123_000020_000002.wav|"And I say that murders are committed here," said Morrel, whose voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: "I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months.
84_121123_000031_000000.wav|"Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!"
84_121123_000058_000000.wav|"no" said Villefort; "fetch the nearest."
84_121123_000034_000000.wav|"Yes."
84_121123_000062_000003.wav|For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.
84_121123_000012_000008.wav|Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest."
84_121123_000063_000000.wav|"Ah," said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; "yes, I have heard that death is in that house."
84_121123_000010_000000.wav|Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who, almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father.
84_121123_000054_000003.wav|But he stopped on the landing; he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber.
84_121123_000008_000001.wav|The terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man.
84_121123_000045_000003.wav|"You can come," he said, and led them back to Noirtier. Morrel looked attentively on Villefort.
84_121123_000009_000000.wav|But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight.
84_121123_000050_000001.wav|Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him.
84_121123_000065_000000.wav|"I was about to offer myself, sir," said the priest; "it is our mission to forestall our duties."
84_121123_000050_000005.wav|Villefort continued: "He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him.
84_121123_000008_000004.wav|"Go!--do you hear?" said Villefort, while d'Avrigny advanced to lead Morrel out.
84_121123_000008_000003.wav|"Who are you, sir," he asked, "that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death? Go, sir, go!" But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it.
84_121123_000017_000004.wav|"Yes," indicated the old man.
84_121123_000056_000004.wav|The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by d'Avrigny.
84_121123_000012_000006.wav|But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth-she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men.
84_121123_000036_000000.wav|"no"
2428_83705_000001_000005.wav|Her manner was not at all the sort of thing I care for. The result is that I am engaged to Mary Ann Snelling without being conscious of having entertained any intention of the kind.
2428_83705_000009_000000.wav|There was William Henry, john Frank, Ferdinand Augustus, and Stephen Arthur.
2428_83705_000028_000001.wav|'A bird in the hand is worth two in a bush'--and it will be something to have by us."
2428_83705_000009_000001.wav|Each of them twice my size and all of them frightfully ignorant and wholly regardless of the sensitive little points of those with whom they came in contact.
2428_83705_000023_000000.wav|I endeavoured to explain to her that I felt sure of it; but I fear that my explanation was a little stumbling.
2428_83705_000038_000002.wav|On the other hand, she is well qualified to protect me from the rest of the family.
2428_83705_000002_000002.wav|Her father is a most remarkable person, to say the least.
2428_83705_000006_000003.wav|The mere suggestion is absurd.
2428_83705_000007_000000.wav|The accident in question occurred upon the Sunday evening.
2428_83705_000030_000002.wav|I have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present, and I shall tell them what they ought to give-it won't be my fault if I don't get it.
2428_83705_000026_000001.wav|She drew up a plan on which we were to lay it out.
2428_83705_000037_000001.wav|It is true that they are a trifle large for me, and that I shall never be able to keep them on my feet except when I am sitting still.
2428_83705_000006_000002.wav|Nothing of the kind.
2428_83705_000019_000001.wav|I shall do nothing of the kind."
2428_83705_000032_000000.wav|But I am bound to admit that so far my success has been as nothing compared with hers.
2428_83705_000001_000001.wav|Her face was close to mine, or my face was close to hers, and then her lips came into contact with my lips, or my lips came into contact with her lips-I don't know which it was-and then at that moment her mother came into the room, and she said, "mr
2428_83705_000039_000007.wav|Besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we don't use.
2428_83705_000038_000003.wav|She will keep them at bay.
2428_83705_000015_000000.wav|They produced the ring, and told me what I had to pay for it.
2428_83705_000030_000001.wav|I will take care that my relations do their duty.
2428_83705_000018_000001.wav|The woman's name is Brady.
2428_83705_000003_000001.wav|I do not know what he meant, and would rather not attempt to imagine.
2428_83705_000023_000001.wav|But she went on with the most perfect fluency.
2428_83705_000027_000001.wav|And, of course, I had my expectations, and she had hers.
2428_83705_000007_000002.wav|I did not go and purchase the engagement ring the first thing on the Monday morning, I own it.
2428_83705_000032_000003.wav|She has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants, which is a little short of miraculous.
2428_83705_000007_000005.wav|I was not pressed for time.
2428_83705_000039_000000.wav|p s--The cards are out for the wedding.
2428_83705_000018_000005.wav|Mary Ann was silent for some time; then she quietly remarked:
2428_83705_000025_000001.wav|We had a long confidential chat on matters of business.
2428_83705_000001_000002.wav|Whiting, may I ask what is the meaning of this?" I said it meant nothing-nothing!
2428_83705_000022_000000.wav|"Do you know that in marrying me you are doing the best thing for yourself that you ever did in all your life?"
2428_83705_000017_000002.wav|It is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs.
2428_83705_000035_000000.wav|"Her love."
2428_83705_000032_000002.wav|It is certain that we have a large collection of really valuable property about the house-the wedding presents to Mary Ann.
2428_83705_000039_000004.wav|He has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey, and all the way back again; and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel.
2428_83705_000007_000003.wav|Certainly not.
2428_83705_000016_000001.wav|Her head dropped on my shoulder, and she kissed me under the chin, observing, "You dear old Sam." The moments when I am alone with Mary Ann are alleviations for those more frequent moments when I am not alone with Mary Ann.
2428_83705_000039_000003.wav|A second cousin of Mary Ann's is in the Cook's Tours line.
2428_83705_000039_000001.wav|It is to take place on Tuesday fortnight.
2428_83705_000027_000002.wav|It was plain that together we should manage most comfortably.
2428_83705_000015_000004.wav|I did not want any unpleasantness; and I am quite sure there would have been unpleasantness had I demurred.
2428_83705_000038_000001.wav|It is true that there are times when I am a little disposed to wish that she were not quite so good a manager; now and then every man likes to call his soul his own.
2428_83705_000038_000006.wav|If she had been like me they would have rent us limb from limb.
2428_83705_000008_000001.wav|But that was no reason why, the Monday week following, four of her brothers should have called on me on their way to the office, when I was scarcely out of bed, and actually breakfasting, and assailed me in the way in which they did.
2428_83705_000021_000000.wav|After dinner I took advantage of an opportunity which offered to thank Mary Ann for her action in the matter, because, of course, I had no wish to spend my honeymoon in a place of which I knew nothing, to oblige an aunt of whom I knew still less.
2428_83705_000025_000000.wav|Such an assurance was most satisfactory.
2428_83705_000011_000000.wav|I gasped-positively gasped.
2428_83705_000009_000003.wav|It was Frederick Augustus; if the thing is possible he is, if anything, more direct even than the rest of his family.
2428_83705_000039_000006.wav|So that, as Mary Ann says, our honeymoon need cost us practically nothing.
2428_83705_000034_000002.wav|"And what," inquired mrs Macpherson, "has Mary Ann given you?"
2428_83705_000037_000002.wav|But Mary Ann does not seem to think that that matters, so why should I? Her youngest sister, Clara Louisa, has quite gratuitously informed me that she has had them by her for some considerable time, and that, not to put too fine a point on it, they were originally designed for another individual altogether-a mr Pilbeam.
2428_83705_000026_000000.wav|I told her exactly what my income was; and the source from which it came, and all about it.
2428_83705_000007_000001.wav|I had been with Mary Ann to church, and had seen her home, and had had a little supper, and it was after supper that it happened.
2428_83705_000040_000000.wav|Nothing could be more delightful.
2428_83705_000026_000003.wav|I had never had one, but I saw clearly that in that way the money would go twice as far.
2428_83705_000034_000001.wav|I have given Mary Ann two or three trifles, and I said so.
2428_83705_000015_000001.wav|A handsome price it was.
2428_83705_000005_000002.wav|It is most delightful.
2428_83705_000038_000007.wav|As it is, unless I am mistaken, some of the rending will be on our side.
2428_83705_000013_000001.wav|From a cousin of ours who's in that line."
2428_83705_000001_000004.wav|Only I found it difficult to explain, and when I did explain she would not understand.
2428_83705_000020_000001.wav|The members of the family looked at one another.
2428_83705_000006_000005.wav|The alteration which has taken place in their demeanour since my accident with Mary Ann is, therefore, all the more amazing.
2428_83705_000006_000000.wav|And it is all the result of an accident.
2428_83705_000018_000003.wav|When she heard of my engagement with Mary Ann, she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage, or pigstye, and that I should pay her rent for it.
2428_83705_000013_000000.wav|"That's it; on your account.
2428_83705_000009_000002.wav|There is no circumlocution about them. They go straight at what they want; and were scarcely inside my door before they blurted out the purport of their coming.
2428_83705_000002_000000.wav|Not that I have a word to say against Mary Ann, except that I never knew a girl with quite so many relations.
2428_83705_000028_000000.wav|"I shall make papa give me five hundred pounds, at least.
2428_83705_000031_000001.wav|At least I drew up a list of people who ought to meet the occasion, and I tried in more than one instance to drop a hint of what, as I felt, they ought to meet it with.
2428_83705_000025_000002.wav|I found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations.
2428_83705_000018_000004.wav|The matter was talked about at dinner.
2428_83705_000010_000001.wav|The girl is fretting, but you don't seem to notice it.
2428_83705_000018_000000.wav|The Snellings have an aunt who lives in an out of the way hole at the other end of nowhere.
2428_83705_000005_000003.wav|It might just as well be some one else's wedding, so unimportant is the part which I am set to play in it.
2428_83705_000007_000004.wav|Nor did I take any steps in that direction during the whole of that week.
2428_83705_000030_000003.wav|Of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain, but I shall be as plain as I can; there's a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing.
2428_83705_000027_000003.wav|Delightfully, in fact.
2428_83705_000038_000005.wav|Which is just as well.
2428_83705_000002_000001.wav|To begin with she had six brothers and five sisters, and she is the eldest of the batch, and there's not one of the brothers whom I feel drawn to.
2428_83705_000019_000000.wav|"Don't trouble yourselves to discuss Aunt Brady's proposal.
2428_83705_000032_000001.wav|Hers has been prodigious.
2428_83705_000015_000002.wav|I was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of Mary Ann's engagement ring.
2428_83705_000039_000005.wav|It's a wedding present.
2428_83705_000020_000002.wav|But, after a very considerable pause, her mother said, with quite unusual mildness, "Very well, my dear. Then, it's settled."
2428_83705_000010_000000.wav|"Look here, Whiting, how about Mary Ann's ring?
2428_83705_000036_000002.wav|But that is not the only society the world contains.
2428_83705_000000_000001.wav|WHITING AND MARY ANN.
2428_83705_000036_000000.wav|Someone sniggered.
2428_83705_000024_000000.wav|"You want someone who can look after you; and you could not, by any chance, have chosen a person who will look after you better than I shall."
2428_83705_000031_000000.wav|I endeavoured to.
2428_83705_000016_000002.wav|Still I noticed that the ring fitted her perfectly, and I could not but wonder if she had tried it on before.
2428_83705_000020_000000.wav|This observation was followed by perfect silence.
2428_83705_000033_000005.wav|But why, on that account, they should pity me, I altogether fail to understand.
2428_83705_000023_000002.wav|There were no signs of faltering about her flow of language.
2428_83705_000026_000002.wav|It was an admirable plan.
2428_83705_000036_000001.wav|I cannot pretend to explain why, except on the supposition that romance is dead; at least in that circle of society in which the Snellings move.
2428_83705_000006_000001.wav|I deny that for the last six months I have been using mr Snelling's home as if it were a boarding house.
2428_83705_000010_000002.wav|And as you don't appear to know what is the proper thing to do in a case of this kind, and don't understand that the ring ought to be bought straight away, we've bought it for you."
2428_83705_000001_000003.wav|Absolutely nothing!
2428_83705_000033_000002.wav|The fact of having given Mary Ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which, to me, is inexplicable.
2428_83705_000001_000000.wav|I did not mean to kiss her; it was a pure accident.
2428_83705_000030_000004.wav|I have no intention of being presented with an endless collection of duplicates, or a lot of useless rubbish which I don't know what to do with.
2428_83705_000006_000004.wav|It is true that I have dropped in to dinner now and then, or to spend the evening, or for an afternoon call, or for an hour or two in the morning; but that has been simply and solely because the Snelling family have evinced so marked a desire for my society.
2428_83705_000039_000002.wav|We are going for our honeymoon to Italy and the South of France.
2428_83705_000021_000001.wav|Mary Ann beamed at me, and she said, "You dear old man!" Presently she continued:
2428_83705_000027_000000.wav|It turned out that she had a little money of her own; about a hundred and thirty pounds a year.
2428_83705_000033_000003.wav|My belief is that they have been induced to spend at least twice as much as they intended, and that they resent it.
2428_83705_000034_000000.wav|"We have all been giving Mary Ann presents, and I suppose you, mr Whiting, have been giving her something too." That was what mrs Macpherson said to me only the other day.
2428_83705_000038_000008.wav|And they know it!
2428_83705_000005_000001.wav|All, apparently, that is left for me to do, is to pay for everything.
2428_83705_000008_000000.wav|Besides, I was turning things over in my mind.
2428_83705_000014_000000.wav|I never saw people like the Snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of "lines." No matter what you want, or do not want, and never will want, they are sure to have some relative who has dealt in it, his or her whole life long.
2428_83705_000018_000002.wav|There she owns a cottage, or it may be a pigstye for all I know.
2428_83699_000011_000004.wav|And it kept on snowing; that turned out to be quite a record in the way of snow storms.
2428_83699_000022_000000.wav|"Why do you ask?"
2428_83699_000021_000000.wav|There was something in the tone of his "Ah!" which whetted my curiosity, near the end of my tether though I was.
2428_83699_000039_000001.wav|My temper was rising.
2428_83699_000015_000006.wav|So I had to cool my heels for two hours and a half in a wretched cowshed amidst a bitter, whirling snowstorm.
2428_83699_000012_000003.wav|I am no dealer in poisons.
2428_83699_000030_000002.wav|Maybe they're up to some of their games, and wants rousing."
2428_83699_000030_000000.wav|"Better ring again," suggested the driver.
2428_83699_000015_000004.wav|His wrangling and jangling so upset me, that I went past the station at which I ought to have changed.
2428_83699_000033_000004.wav|Better ring again."
2428_83699_000039_000003.wav|I tolled the bell again.
2428_83699_000040_000000.wav|"Can I see mrs Wilson?
2428_83699_000036_000000.wav|The information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter.
2428_83699_000009_000000.wav|Now it is a remarkable thing that I have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name Madge.
2428_83699_000019_000000.wav|"I am."
2428_83699_000025_000001.wav|Suddenly the cart pulled up.
2428_83699_000034_000002.wav|A voice inquired: "Who's there?"
2428_83699_000024_000002.wav|I was beyond it.
2428_83699_000027_000001.wav|It was a pity he did not add where "here" was.
2428_83699_000031_000000.wav|Was there a chuckle in the fellow's voice?
2428_83699_000039_000005.wav|Again a light gleamed through the pane.
2428_83699_000044_000001.wav|I'm afraid I can offer you nothing to drink.
2428_83699_000012_000001.wav|I had not given a Christmas present for years-there had been no one to give them to.
2428_83699_000042_000002.wav|The driver's voice came from the background.
2428_83699_000010_000002.wav|I did not expect a princely entertainment.
2428_83699_000045_000000.wav|"I can't say rightly as how I should, Miss.
2428_83699_000017_000000.wav|There was a trap at the "Boy and Blunderbuss," but that required fetching.
2428_83699_000014_000008.wav|No doubt they would set him down as a lunatic right away.
2428_83699_000036_000001.wav|There was a rush of retreating feet, an expostulating voice, then darkness again, and silence.
2428_83699_000027_000003.wav|The whereabouts of this, however, the driver presently made clear.
2428_83699_000039_000008.wav|The storm rushed in; she put up her hand to shield the light from danger.
2428_83699_000029_000003.wav|No answer; though I allowed a more than decent interval.
2428_83699_000016_000001.wav|I counted seven in a distance, I am convinced, of less than twenty miles.
2428_83699_000014_000005.wav|I hoped to goodness that he would not prove to be a hypochondriac, like Lucy's husband.
2428_83699_000011_000001.wav|All night it had been blowing and raining.
2428_83699_000008_000004.wav|I might arrive, it seemed, on Christmas Eve, but there was no hint as to when I was to go, if ever.
2428_83699_000034_000001.wav|Presently feet were heard advancing along the passage-several pairs it seemed-and a light gleamed through the window over the door.
2428_83699_000044_000002.wav|We've lost the key of the cellar, and there's nothing out, except water, and I don't think you'd care for that."
2428_83699_000029_000000.wav|There appeared to be no knocker, though whether it had been "twisted" off was more than I could say.
2428_83699_000035_000000.wav|"mr Christopher, from London."
2428_83699_000015_000000.wav|It was a horrible journey.
2428_83699_000008_000000.wav|So I wrote to the advertiser.
2428_83699_000031_000001.wav|I rang again, and again with all the force I could.
2428_83699_000031_000002.wav|The bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house.
2428_83699_000034_000000.wav|I sounded another peal.
2428_83699_000007_000004.wav|Yes!
2428_83699_000012_000000.wav|I had been idiot enough to load myself with a lot of Christmas presents, without the faintest notion why.
2428_83699_000010_000004.wav|As for the "pills" and "drops" with which her husband doses himself between the courses, it makes me ill even to think of them.
2428_83699_000048_000000.wav|"I think I had."
2428_83699_000045_000002.wav|Be it all right?"
2428_83699_000033_000003.wav|If they know you're coming perhaps they hear and don't choose to answer.
2428_83699_000013_000000.wav|I knew nothing of the people I was going to.
2428_83699_000039_000000.wav|Once more I suspected the driver of a chuckle.
2428_83699_000047_000000.wav|"Perhaps you had better come inside."
2428_83699_000015_000001.wav|The trains were late, and, of course, overcrowded; there was enough luggage in our compartment to have filled it, and still there was one more passenger than there ought to have been; an ill conditioned old fellow who wanted my hat box put into the van because it happened to tumble off the rack on to his head.
2428_83699_000013_000001.wav|The youngest member of the family might be twenty, or the oldest ten.
2428_83699_000016_000000.wav|When the train did start, some forty minutes after scheduled time, it jolted along in a laborious fashion at the rate of about six miles an hour, stopping at every roadside hovel.
2428_83699_000032_000000.wav|"Is there no one in the place?"
2428_83699_000011_000003.wav|By the time the streets were like so many skating rinks it commenced to snow.
2428_83699_000014_000006.wav|I would not give him pills.
2428_83699_000050_000000.wav|"Have you any luggage?" I admitted that I had.
2428_83699_000014_000003.wav|Of course, I knew that I had no right to do anything of the kind, and was aware that the chances were a hundred to one against my ever presuming to hint at its existence.
2428_83699_000007_000005.wav|She and her husband, who suffers from melancholia, and all the other complaints which flesh is heir to, and I, dragging through what I call a patent medicine dinner, and talking of everybody who is dead and gone, or else going, and of nothing else.
2428_83699_000052_000000.wav|"Do you think that you could manage, Tidy?"
2428_83699_000043_000000.wav|"I drove him over from the station, Miss.
2428_83699_000026_000000.wav|"Here we be."
2428_83699_000011_000005.wav|Hardly the sort of weather to start for an unknown destination "in the heart of the country." But, at the last moment, I did not like to back out.
2428_83699_000025_000000.wav|We passed through a gate, which I had to get down to open, along some sort of avenue.
2428_83699_000017_000001.wav|Finally the hulking lad was dispatched.
2428_83699_000049_000000.wav|I went inside; it was time.
2428_83699_000014_000007.wav|What the "lively family" would think of a perfect stranger arriving burdened with rubbish, as if he had known them all their lives, I did not dare to think.
2428_83699_000005_000000.wav|THE PROMISE.
2428_83699_000010_000003.wav|Still I felt that it could hardly be worse than a chop or cousin Lucy; the subjects of her conversation I never cared about when they were alive, and I certainly do not want to talk about them now they are dead.
2428_83699_000011_000006.wav|I said I would go, and I meant to go.
2428_83699_000028_000002.wav|If they have, there's a bell on your right, if it isn't broken."
2428_83699_000053_000000.wav|"The mare, she'll stand still enough.
2428_83699_000007_000000.wav|That was the advertisement.
2428_83699_000045_000001.wav|Next time will do.
2428_83699_000009_000003.wav|And yet, from my boyhood upward, I have desired to meet one. Here was an opportunity offered.
2428_83699_000008_000005.wav|The whole thing was a trifle odd.
2428_83699_000015_000002.wav|I pointed out to him that the rack was specially constructed for light luggage, that a hat box was light luggage, and that if the train jolted, he ought to blame the company, not me.
2428_83699_000003_000000.wav|AN old-fashioned CHRISTMAS.
2428_83699_000038_000000.wav|"Well-thereabouts."
2428_83699_000017_000004.wav|Never shall I forget the drive, in that miserable cart, through the storm and those pitch black country lanes.
2428_83699_000040_000001.wav|I'm expected.
2428_83699_000039_000007.wav|After a vast amount of unfastening, the door was opened, and on the threshold there stood a girl, with a lighted candle in her hand.
2428_83699_000009_000004.wav|She was apparently the careworn mother of a "lively family." Under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be "lively" herself, but her name was Madge, and it was the accident of her Christian name which decided me to go.
2428_83699_000024_000004.wav|I had long been wishing that an old-fashioned Christmas had been completely extinct before I had thought of adventuring in quest of one.
2428_83699_000015_000007.wav|It is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that I made it warm for the officials, however cold I might have been myself.
2428_83699_000037_000001.wav|Are the people mad?"
2428_83699_000007_000002.wav|I was not sure what, in this case, an old-fashioned Christmas might happen to mean.
2428_83699_000018_000000.wav|"Be you going to stop with they Wilsons?"
2428_83699_000024_000001.wav|I did not ask.
2428_83699_000014_000001.wav|I felt quite lively myself as I mingled with the Christmas crowd, looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous.
2428_83699_000039_000004.wav|After a few seconds' interval the pit pat of what was obviously one pair of feet came towards the door.
2428_83699_000050_000001.wav|"Perhaps it had better be brought in."
2428_83699_000013_000004.wav|That is a fact.
2428_83699_000027_000002.wav|There was a great shadow, which possibly did duty for a house, but, if so, there was not a light in any of the windows, and there was nothing visible in the shape of a door.
2428_83699_000015_000003.wav|He was impervious to reason.
2428_83699_000008_000003.wav|It appeared that the terms would be five guineas; but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover.
2428_83699_000039_000002.wav|I had not come all that way, and subjected myself to so much discomfort, to be played tricks with.
2428_83699_000043_000001.wav|There be a lot of luggage. He do say he's come to stay with you."
2428_83699_000011_000000.wav|On Christmas Eve the weather was abominable.
2428_83699_000024_000003.wav|I was chilled to the bone, wet, tired, hungry.
2428_83699_000010_000001.wav|No doubt the five guineas were badly wanted; even a "lively family" would be hardly likely to advertise for a perfect stranger to spend Christmas with them if they were not.
2428_83699_000029_000002.wav|I heard it tinkle in the distance.
2428_83699_000016_000002.wav|When at last I reached Crofton, my journey's end, it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual, who was stationmaster, porter, and clerk combined, and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do.
2428_83699_000027_000000.wav|That might be so.
2428_83699_000030_000001.wav|"Hard.
2428_83699_000042_000001.wav|I looked at her; she at me.
2428_83699_000015_000005.wav|Then I had to wait three quarters of an hour for a train to take me back again, only to find that I had missed the one I intended to catch.
2428_83699_000042_000000.wav|That was all she said.
2428_83699_000006_000000.wav|"An old-fashioned Christmas.--A lively family will accept a gentleman as paying guest to join them in spending an old-fashioned Christmas in the heart of the country."
2428_83699_000008_000007.wav|No references were offered or asked for.
2428_83699_000011_000002.wav|In the morning it began to freeze.
2428_83699_000023_000000.wav|"It be about time as someone were to stay with them as were a bit capable like."
2428_83699_000008_000006.wav|There was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided, nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained, or the table which was kept.
2428_83699_000008_000001.wav|The reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand.
2428_83699_000014_000002.wav|I even bought something for Madge-I mean mrs Wilson.
2428_83699_000013_000003.wav|Still, if you have not tried your hand at that kind of thing for ever so long, the mere act of purchasing is a pleasure.
2428_83699_000007_000001.wav|It had its points.
2428_83699_000004_000000.wav|CHAPTER one
2428_83699_000033_000001.wav|Where's another thing.
7850_73752_000003_000002.wav|Ferdinand felt his freedom as well as his happiness.
7850_73752_000002_000001.wav|It requires some self communion to prepare ourselves for good fortune, as well as to encounter difficulty, and danger, and disgrace.
7850_73752_000003_000013.wav|Ferdinand Armine, who, two days back, deemed himself alone in the world!
7850_73752_000002_000000.wav|IN MOMENTS of deep feeling, alike sudden bursts of prosperity as in darker hours, man must be alone.
7850_73752_000003_000012.wav|What man in the world had friends like Ferdinand Armine?
7850_73752_000005_000000.wav|It was barely a year since he had returned from Malta, but what an eventful twelvemonth!
7850_73752_000009_000000.wav|In exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world; the pangs of love, the throbs of ambition, the wear and tear of play, the recriminating boudoir, the conspiring club, the rattling hell; and find himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of Lebanon, and inferior only in extent to the chestnut forests of Anatolia.
7850_73752_000003_000010.wav|A noble fortune, which would permit him to redeem his inheritance, and rank him among the richest commoners of the realm, was to be controlled by one a few hours back a prisoner for desperate debts.
7850_73752_000008_000001.wav|It seems to the writer of this history that the inhabitants of London are scarcely sufficiently sensible of the beauty of its environs.
7850_73752_000005_000001.wav|Everything that had occurred previously seemed of another life; all his experience was concentrated in that wonderful drama that had commenced at Bath, the last scene of which was now approaching; the characters, his parents, Glastonbury, Katherine, Henrietta, Lord Montfort, Count Mirabel, himself, and mr Temple!
7850_73752_000007_000000.wav|In the present unsettled, though hopeful state of affairs, Ferdinand would not go home.
7850_73752_000003_000005.wav|Restless with impending joy, he sauntered to the bridge, and leant over the balustrade, gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacancy.
7850_73752_000006_000003.wav|What a Neapolitan ball was his career then!
7850_73752_000008_000003.wav|With the exception of Constantinople, there is no city in the world that can for a moment enter into competition with it.
7850_73752_000003_000006.wav|How many incidents, how many characters, how many feelings flitted over his memory!
7850_73752_000003_000015.wav|He could not flatter himself that he indeed merited such singular blessings; and yet with all his faults, which with him were but the consequences of his fiery youth, Ferdinand had been faithful, to Henrietta.
7850_73752_000009_000001.wav|Kensington Gardens is almost the only place that has realised his idea of the forests of Spenser and Ariosto.

7850_281318_000012_000003.wav|Well, it was the Magpie who taught him how, and he was the prize pupil, to be sure.

7850_281318_000017_000001.wav|"I knew that came next. That is what I told the Parrot but a moment since."
7850_281318_000010_000000.wav|The Magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient, diligent, obedient class of little birds.
7850_281318_000014_000000.wav|Mother Magpie took two sticks in her beak and began like this: "First of all, my friends, you must lay two sticks crosswise for a foundation, thus," and she placed them carefully on the branch before her.
7850_281318_000016_000000.wav|Mother Magpie snapped her eyes at him and went on, "Next you must lay a feather on a bit of moss, to start the walls."
7850_281318_000012_000005.wav|Some of them were lazy and stupid and envious of Mother Magpie's cosy nest, which was already finished, while theirs was yet to do.
7850_281318_000001_000000.wav|Did you ever notice how different are the nests which the birds build in springtime, in tree or bush or sandy bank or hidden in the grass?
7850_281318_000028_000000.wav|But Mother Magpie was thoroughly disgusted, and refused to go on with the lesson which had been so rudely interrupted by her pupils.
7850_281318_000030_000002.wav|The lesson was but half finished, and most of them had not the slightest idea what to do next. That is why to this day many of the birds have never learned to build a perfect nest.
7850_281318_000011_000004.wav|It was like a great big kindergarten of birds playing at a new building game, with Mother Magpie for the teacher.
7850_281318_000003_000002.wav|Already she had found out a way, and was busily building a famous nest for herself.
7850_281318_000003_000004.wav|She gathered turf and sticks, and with clay bound them firmly together in a stout elm tree.
7850_281318_000001_000006.wav|Indeed, it is not a nest at all, only the beginning of one.
7850_281318_000006_000002.wav|"Mother Magpie has found a way.

7850_281318_000012_000001.wav|And some of the birds, who were attentive and careful, soon saw how it was done, and started nice homes for themselves.
7850_281318_000009_000000.wav|"O wise Mother Magpie, dear Mother Magpie," they cried, "teach us how to build our nests like yours, for it is growing night, and we are tired and sleepy."
7850_281318_000019_000002.wav|Tell us something new."
7850_281318_000010_000001.wav|And they all promised that they would.

7850_281318_000029_000002.wav|Much luck may you have!" And away she flew to her own cosy nest in the elm tree, where she was soon fast asleep, forgetting all about the matter.
7850_281318_000007_000000.wav|Then all the other birds chirped eagerly, "Yes, yes!

7850_286674_000006_000004.wav|They did not breathe it into their mouths, or through gills, but took it in through some openings in the back part of their bodies.
7850_286674_000006_000005.wav|When they wanted to hurry, they breathed this water out so suddenly that it sent them quickly ahead.
7850_286674_000005_000002.wav|They always ate plain food and plenty of it, and they never ate between meals.
7850_286674_000001_000003.wav|The Dragon Flies may be very good people-and even the Snapping Turtle says that they are-still, they are so peculiar that many of their neighbors do not like them at all.
7850_286674_000014_000000.wav|When they reached the shallow water, the Dragon Fly children stood close together, with the larvae in the middle and the Nymphs all around them. The Snapping Turtle was nowhere to be seen, so they had to wait.
7850_286674_000013_000004.wav|Indeed, the lower lip of a Dragon Fly child might well frighten people, for it is fastened on a long, jointed, arm like thing, and has pincers on it with which it catches and holds its food.
7850_286674_000018_000000.wav|Sure enough, there he came through the shallow water, his wet back shell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight.
7850_286674_000010_000000.wav|"I tell you what let's do," said another Nymph.
7850_286674_000005_000003.wav|They had breakfast from the time they awakened in the morning until the sun was high in the sky, then they had dinner until the sun was low in the sky, and supper from that time until it grew dark and they went to sleep: but never a mouthful between meals, no matter how hungry they might be.
7850_286674_000003_000000.wav|The Minnow Mothers did not think it was so much in the way the eggs were laid, "although," said one, "I always lay mine close together, instead of scattering them over the whole pond." They thought the trouble came from bad bringing up or no bringing up at all.

7850_286674_000006_000001.wav|You would think that, with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg, they might walk quite fast, yet they never did.
7850_286674_000005_000001.wav|Their stomachs were as long as their bodies, and they were never really happy unless their stomachs were full.
7850_286674_000006_000002.wav|When they had to, they hurried in another way by taking a long leap through the water.
7850_286674_000005_000000.wav|Like most growing children, the Dragon Fly larvae and Nymphs had to eat a great deal.
7850_286674_000015_000002.wav|Who's afraid," answered he.
7850_286674_000012_000001.wav|"Our upper lips are so small they don't matter."
7850_286674_000008_000000.wav|"Horrid old thing!" said one larva.
7850_286674_000012_000000.wav|"Well, our lower lips anyway," answered the Nymph.
7850_286674_000002_000004.wav|It is disgraceful!"
7850_286674_000013_000002.wav|They knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fishes and bugs, they swam away as fast as they could.
7850_286674_000004_000000.wav|Now most of the larvae were turning into Nymphs, which are half grown Dragon Flies.
7850_286674_000014_000001.wav|"Aren't you scared?" whispered one larva to another.
7850_286674_000018_000001.wav|He came straight toward the Dragon Fly children, and they were glad to see that he did not look hungry.
7850_286674_000001_000002.wav|A person would think that, after a family had lived so long in a place, all the neighbors would be fond of them, yet it is not so.
7850_286674_000002_000001.wav|"What can you expect," exclaimed one of them, "when Dragon Fly eggs are so carelessly laid?
7850_286674_000001_000000.wav|The Dragon Flies have always lived near the pond.
7850_286674_000016_000002.wav|Just you wait until I change my skin once more, and then won't I have a good time!
7850_286674_000018_000003.wav|They thought he might run away when they did this.
7850_286674_000004_000002.wav|They had outgrown their old skins a great many times, and had to wriggle out of them to be at all comfortable.
7850_286674_000013_000006.wav|But sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him, and then its pincers catch hold of things.
7850_286674_000016_000000.wav|"Oh, look!" cried a Nymph.
7850_286674_000013_000000.wav|"We'll do it," exclaimed all the Dragon Fly children, and they started together to walk on the pond bottom to the shallow water.
7850_286674_000004_000001.wav|They had been short and plump, and now they were longer and more slender, and there were little bunches on their shoulders where the wings were growing under their skin.
7850_286674_000006_000000.wav|They were always slow children.
7850_286674_000001_000004.wav|Even when they are only larvae, or babies, they are not good playmates, for they have such a bad habit of putting everything into their mouths.
7850_286674_000013_000003.wav|The Giant Water Bug (Belostoma), was the only bug who was not afraid of them when they made faces.
7850_286674_000002_000000.wav|The Stickleback Mothers said that it was all the fault of the Dragon Fly Mothers.
7850_286674_000013_000001.wav|They thought it would scare the Snapping Turtle dreadfully.
7850_286674_000001_000005.wav|Indeed, the Stickleback Father once told the little Sticklebacks that they should not stir out of the nest, unless they would promise to keep away from the young Dragon Flies.
7850_286674_000002_000003.wav|Just flew around in the sunshine and visited with her friends, and once in a while flew low enough to touch the water and drop one in.
7850_286674_000000_000000.wav|THE DRAGON FLY CHILDREN AND THE SNAPPING TURTLE
7850_286674_000002_000002.wav|I saw a Dragon Fly Mother laying some only yesterday, and how do you suppose she did it?
7850_286674_000009_000002.wav|She was often impatient, and said she could never go anywhere without one of the larvae tagging along.
7850_286674_000013_000005.wav|Most of the time, the Dragon Fly child keeps the joint bent, and so holds his lip up to his face like a mask.
7850_286674_000007_000001.wav|They all put their queer little three cornered heads together, and there was an ugly look in their great staring eyes.
7850_286674_000018_000002.wav|They thought he might be going to take a nap after his dinner. Then they all stood even closer together and stuck out their lower lips at him.
7850_286674_000009_000000.wav|"Well, you can't," said a Nymph, turning towards him so suddenly that he leaped.
7850_286674_000008_000001.wav|"I wish I could sting him."
7850_286674_000001_000001.wav|Not the same ones that are there now, of course, but the great great great grandfathers of these.
251_136532_000007_000001.wav|The discovery of the University had focused attention on the dead past of Mars; now the public was interested in Mars as a possible home for humanity.
251_136532_000017_000000.wav|"Isn't this something!" Lattimer was exulting.
251_136532_000015_000000.wav|She slammed the phone back on its hook, rushing away ahead of them.
251_136532_000017_000002.wav|Notice what's in the corners?"
251_136532_000024_000001.wav|The organization of a Society of Martian Archaeology, with Anthony Lattimer, p h d, the logical candidate for the chair.
251_136532_000007_000002.wav|It was Tony Lattimer who brought archaeology back into the activities of the expedition and the news at home.
251_136532_000002_000002.wav|At least, it was a something with wings and what were almost but not quite feathers, though it was more reptilian than avian in general characteristics.
251_136532_000021_000000.wav|"Not that I'm interested in all this, for myself," he disclaimed, after listening to the telecast from Terra two days after his discovery.
251_136532_000022_000000.wav|"In nineteen twenty three?
251_136532_000012_000001.wav|"Little room, back of one of the old faculty offices-conference room.
251_136532_000003_000000.wav|That took the center of interest away from archaeology, and started a new burst of activity.
251_136532_000014_000001.wav|Well, of course they're dead.
251_136532_000024_000003.wav|Positions, with impressive titles and salaries.
251_136532_000001_000001.wav|They located the city, and learned that its name had been Kukan-or something with a similar vowel consonant ratio.
251_136532_000018_000000.wav|Braziers, made of perforated two gallon odd metal cans, the white walls smudged with smoke above them.
251_136532_000000_000001.wav|Shortly afterward, the malady turned into a mild fever, from which she recovered.
251_136532_000017_000001.wav|"Mass suicide, that's what it was.
251_136532_000014_000005.wav|Well, forget it; I don't care if Bill Chandler's found a three headed hippopotamus.
251_136532_000019_000000.wav|"Yes; charcoal.
251_136532_000008_000000.wav|Martha and Selim were working in the museum on the second floor, scrubbing the grime from the glass cases, noting contents, and grease penciling numbers; Lattimer and a couple of Space Force officers were going through what had been the administrative offices on the other side.
251_136532_000024_000004.wav|Sweet are the uses of publicity.
251_136532_000011_000000.wav|"Where?" they asked together.
251_136532_000023_000002.wav|But I think it's important that one of us go back, to present the story of our work, and what we have accomplished and what we hope to accomplish, to the public and to the universities and the learned societies, and to the Federation Government.
251_136532_000010_000000.wav|Selim dropped his rag back in the bucket; she laid her clipboard on top of the case beside her.
251_136532_000005_000000.wav|Sometimes Sachiko dropped in; most of the time she was busy helping Ivan Fitzgerald dissect specimens.
251_136532_000023_000004.wav|We must not allow the other scientific fields and the so-called practical interests to monopolize public and academic support.
251_136532_000019_000004.wav|They must have been all that were left, here.
251_136532_000001_000002.wav|Immediately, Sid Chamberlain and Gloria Standish began giving their telecasts a Kukan dateline, and Hubert Penrose used the name in his official reports.
251_136532_000023_000001.wav|"I'd hoped it would be you; your voice would carry the most weight.
251_136532_000014_000004.wav|No, I do not know what they died of.
251_136532_000014_000003.wav|They look like skeletons covered with leather.
251_136532_000018_000001.wav|Von Ohlmhorst had noticed them at once, and was poking into one of them with his flashlight.
251_136532_000019_000006.wav|So they just came in here and lit the charcoal, and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep.
251_136532_000024_000000.wav|Lectures.
251_136532_000019_000002.wav|That's why you had so much trouble breaking in; they'd sealed the room on the inside." He straightened and went around the room, until he found a ventilator, and peered into it.
251_136532_000002_000003.wav|He and Ivan Fitzgerald skinned and mounted it, and then dissected the carcass almost tissue by tissue.
251_136532_000000_000003.wav|Fitzgerald was still trying to find out how the germ had been transmitted.
251_136532_000006_000000.wav|The high point came when one party, at thirty thousand feet below the level of Kukan, found breathable air.
251_136532_000007_000000.wav|The daily newscasts from Terra showed a corresponding shift in interest at home.
251_136532_000016_000006.wav|Skeletons covered with leather, Gloria Standish had called them, and so they were-faces like skulls, arms and legs like sticks, the flesh shrunken onto the bones under it.
251_136532_000004_000001.wav|The civilian specialists in other fields, and the Space Force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras, were all flying to lower Syrtis to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported.
251_136532_000014_000002.wav|What a question!
251_136532_000002_000001.wav|Four hundred miles from Kukan, and at fifteen thousand feet lower altitude, he shot a bird.
251_136532_000026_000001.wav|Let the infantry do the slogging through the mud; the brass hats got the medals.
251_136532_000002_000004.wav|About seven eighths of its body capacity was lungs; it certainly breathed air containing at least half enough oxygen to support human life, or five times as much as the air around Kukan.
251_136532_000016_000005.wav|Another had fallen forward onto the table, arms extended, the emerald set of a ring twinkling dully on one finger.
251_136532_000020_000001.wav|The Terran public wanted to hear about Martians, and if live Martians couldn't be found, a room full of dead ones was the next best thing.
251_136532_000012_000000.wav|"Over on the north side." The lieutenant took hold of himself and spoke more deliberately.
251_136532_000012_000004.wav|Eighteen of them, around a long table-"
251_136532_000014_000006.wav|Sid, don't you get it?
251_136532_000009_000001.wav|dr von Ohlmhorst!" he was shouting.
251_136532_000008_000001.wav|It was one of these, a young second lieutenant, who came hurrying in from the mezzanine, almost bursting with excitement.
251_136532_000016_000001.wav|Now it was burned away at both sides and lay, still hot along the edges, on the floor of the big office room in front. A floodlight was on in the room inside, and Lattimer was going around looking at things while a Space Force officer stood by the door.
251_136532_000016_000000.wav|Martha remembered the closed door; on the first survey, they hadn't attempted opening it.
251_136532_000021_000002.wav|Bring it to the public attention; dramatize it.
251_136532_000016_000002.wav|The center of the room was filled by a long table; in armchairs around it sat the eighteen men and women who had occupied the room for the last fifty millennia.
251_136532_000013_000000.wav|Gloria Standish, who had dropped in for lunch, was on the mezzanine, fairly screaming into a radiophone extension:
251_136532_000022_000004.wav|And, for a while, it was easier to get financial support for new excavations.
251_136532_000020_000002.wav|Maybe an even better thing; it had been only sixty odd years since the Orson Welles invasion scare.
251_136532_000009_000000.wav|"Hey, Martha!
251_136532_000014_000000.wav|" ... Dozen and a half of them!
251_136532_000020_000004.wav|Without question, he had become, overnight, the most widely known archaeologist in history.
251_136532_000024_000002.wav|Degrees, honors; the deference of the learned, and the adulation of the lay public.
251_136532_000000_000002.wav|Nobody else seemed to have caught it.
251_136532_000025_000000.wav|She crushed out her cigarette and got to her feet.
251_136532_000012_000003.wav|That's where they are.
251_136532_000023_000005.wav|So, I believe I shall go back at least for a while, and see what I can do-"
251_136532_000020_000000.wav|Sid and Gloria made the most of it.
251_137823_000007_000000.wav|He broke off with a gasp of astonishment as the whole building suddenly began to shake.
251_137823_000040_000001.wav|"Come on, Bud!
251_137823_000062_000000.wav|"A visitor?" Tom looked at his father.
251_137823_000025_000002.wav|"If that beam had landed square on your noggin, even a rock head like you couldn't have survived!"
251_137823_000015_000002.wav|"The roof! It's caving in!" he heard someone scream.
251_137823_000013_000000.wav|Electronic equipment cascaded from the wall shelves, and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track, plunging to the floor with a terrifying crash.
251_137823_000008_000000.wav|"Good grief!" Bud exclaimed.
251_137823_000042_000002.wav|It's only a few miles away, isn't it?"
251_137823_000055_000001.wav|"We're not stretcher cases," he said.
251_137823_000038_000001.wav|"Right where we landed our Whirling Duck!"
251_137823_000047_000000.wav|Two hours later there was nothing more Tom and Bud could do at the disaster scene and they hitched a ride into Harkness.
251_137823_000018_000000.wav|For minutes, no one stirred among the wreckage.
251_137823_000044_000002.wav|Got a job for us?"
251_137823_000025_000000.wav|"You got conked by a falling timber.
251_137823_000037_000001.wav|"There would've been a lot more casualties."
251_137823_000051_000000.wav|"Don't worry, Sis.
251_137823_000044_000000.wav|"Tough break," Tom sympathized.
251_137823_000024_000002.wav|Wow!...
251_137823_000033_000002.wav|Then Tom taped a bandage on Bud's scalp wound.
251_137823_000024_000003.wav|What hit me?"
251_137823_000031_000000.wav|The two boys scrambled through the clutter of debris toward the spot where the test stand had been erected.
251_137823_000002_000000.wav|"Tom, we're having a problem with the gyro stabilizer," said Mark Faber, gray haired president of the Faber Electronics Company.
251_137823_000033_000000.wav|Of the four other company engineers, two were now stirring and partly conscious.
251_137823_000056_000002.wav|"I was all set for Sandy's cool soothing touch on my fevered brow!"
251_137823_000011_000000.wav|"Look out!
251_137823_000049_000002.wav|Tom asked the operator to send a helicopter immediately to pick them up.
251_137823_000055_000000.wav|Tom laughed.
251_137823_000040_000002.wav|Let's see about getting help for mr Faber!"
251_137823_000017_000001.wav|A falling beam caught him on the back of the head and the young flier blacked out.
251_137823_000050_000000.wav|"What a relief!" Sandy gasped.
251_137823_000022_000002.wav|His friend's eyelids flickered.
251_137823_000042_000000.wav|"mr Faber is badly injured," Tom said.
251_137823_000064_000001.wav|"Wow!" Bud gasped.
251_137823_000012_000002.wav|Before he reached it, another shock knocked all of them off their feet.
251_137823_000049_000003.wav|He also called home and spoke to his sister, Sandra.
251_137823_000055_000002.wav|"Why, one of the ambulance doctors checked us out."
251_137823_000011_000001.wav|The test stand's breaking loose!" Tom warned.
251_137823_000040_000000.wav|"No use fussing about it now," Tom said.
251_137823_000037_000000.wav|"Good thing the main shift of workers knocked off before this happened," Bud observed with a shudder.
251_137823_000008_000001.wav|"This isn't part of your testing routine, is it?"
251_137823_000051_000001.wav|Tell Mother and Dad that we're okay," Tom said. "We'll be home in a jiffy-with big appetites!"
251_137823_000041_000000.wav|Despite the chaotic confusion, the boys managed to locate the plant superintendent-a harried, middle aged man named Simkins-who was doing his best to restore order.
251_137823_000005_000000.wav|The two boys followed mr Faber and his engineers to a wooden building which was tightly guarded.
251_137823_000060_000002.wav|He's a great scientist."
251_137823_000031_000001.wav|Bud seized a slender, steel I beam and managed to pry up the wreckage while Tom carefully extricated mr Faber.
251_137823_000004_000000.wav|Bud Barclay, a dark haired young flier and Tom Swift Jr's closest friend, chuckled.
251_137823_000060_000000.wav|"Mark Faber is not expected to live," the elder inventor reported.
251_137823_000002_000001.wav|"Hope you can find out what's wrong."
251_137823_000039_000000.wav|The boys exchanged rueful glances as they realized that the craft which had brought them to Faber Electronics-one of Tom's unique helijets-had been swallowed up in the gaping chasm.
251_137823_000005_000001.wav|Inside, a secret rocket telemetering device was mounted on its test stand.
251_137823_000032_000000.wav|The scientist seemed to be badly injured.
251_137823_000064_000002.wav|"Male or female? Human or animal?"
251_137823_000018_000001.wav|Then Tom, who had been stunned by some falling debris, raised himself to a sitting position.
251_137823_000054_000001.wav|Phyl, a pretty, dark haired girl, was the daughter of mr Swift's long-time friend and business associate, "Uncle Ned" Newton.
251_137823_000023_000000.wav|"Are you all right?" Tom asked fearfully.
251_137823_000048_000000.wav|"The center of the quake was right under Faber Electronics," Tom remarked.
251_137823_000021_000000.wav|Suddenly Tom stiffened in fear.
251_137823_000059_000001.wav|While they ate, mr Swift managed after some difficulty to get a call through to the Harkness Hospital. His face was grave as he hung up.
251_137823_000035_000000.wav|"Right!" Bud responded.
251_137823_000019_000000.wav|"Good night!" Tom's eyes focused in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust.
251_137823_000061_000001.wav|Sandy, to take her brother's mind off the disaster, said, "Dad, tell Tom and Bud about the visitor who's coming."
251_137823_000003_000000.wav|The eighteen year old inventor accepted the challenge with a smile. "I'll be glad to try, sir," he replied.
251_137823_000036_000000.wav|They picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction.
251_137823_000036_000001.wav|The main plant building of Faber Electronics had been partially demolished by the quake.
251_137823_000046_000000.wav|The telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from Harkness-fire trucks, three ambulances, and private cars driven by volunteers.
251_137823_000036_000002.wav|Power lines were down and an outlying storage shed was ablaze.
251_137823_000027_000000.wav|Somewhat shakily, Bud got to his feet with Tom's assistance.
251_137823_000044_000001.wav|"Anyhow, we want to help.
251_137823_000004_000001.wav|"If anyone can get the bugs out of your new invention, genius boy here will do it!"
251_137823_000025_000001.wav|Or grazed, at least," Tom added thankfully.
251_137823_000006_000000.wav|"As you know, Tom," mr Faber began, "the usual conditions of rocket flight will be-"

251_137823_000060_000001.wav|"A pity.

251_137823_000022_000000.wav|Disregarding his own injuries, Tom hastily freed himself from the debris and groped his way to Bud's side.

251_137823_000009_000001.wav|The walls and roof were shuddering and creaking, and the concrete floor was heaving under their feet.
251_137823_000032_000001.wav|"We'd better not try to move him," Tom decided.
251_137823_000050_000001.wav|"We heard a bulletin about the quake over the radio!"
251_137823_000045_000001.wav|Within minutes, Tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings. Bud organized a fire fighting crew to keep the blaze in the shed from spreading.
251_137823_000036_000003.wav|Dazed and panic stricken survivors were wandering around aimlessly or rushing about to assist the injured.
251_137823_000065_000001.wav|"None of those," he replied as the boys stared, mystified.
251_137823_000064_000000.wav|Both boys were amazed and excited.
251_137823_000063_000000.wav|"From another planet," mr Swift revealed.
251_137823_000054_000002.wav|The two girls were as much upset as Tom's mother.
251_137823_000024_000000.wav|The answer came in a groan.
251_137823_000038_000000.wav|"Look!" Tom pointed to a huge crevasse.
251_137823_000052_000000.wav|The helicopter arrived within twenty minutes at the place Tom had named. After landing at Enterprises, the boys drove to the pleasant, tree shaded Swift home on the outskirts of town.

251_137823_000034_000000.wav|"Let's see if we can find a telephone and call the local hospital," Tom said.
251_137823_000056_000001.wav|"Why did you have to go and spoil it?" he complained jokingly.
251_137823_000026_000001.wav|"We grow 'em tough out in California where I come from!" he joked.
251_137823_000057_000001.wav|"I tried to assure them that you and Bud can take care of yourselves in any crisis." He smiled guiltily as he added, "But I must admit I was more than a little concerned myself."
251_137823_000014_000000.wav|"An earthquake!" Tom gasped.
251_137823_000053_000000.wav|mrs Swift, a slender, petite woman, tried not to show concern when she saw the boys, bruised and disheveled.
251_137823_000033_000001.wav|The boys found a first aid cabinet and gave what help they could to them and the other two men.
251_137823_000047_000001.wav|The town had suffered some damage, though only slight compared to the destruction at the plant.
251_137823_000061_000000.wav|Tom nodded unhappily.
251_137823_000022_000001.wav|With a desperate heave, he shoved the beam away, then cradled Bud's head in his arm.
251_137823_000020_000001.wav|Only two thirds of the walls were still standing.
251_118436_000015_000001.wav|A long drawn wailing rose from the multitude.
251_118436_000017_000001.wav|This man was clad in a brown camel hair robe and sandals, and a green turban was on his head. His expression was tranquil, his gaze impersonal.

251_118436_000023_000001.wav|All discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it, attached to it by intangible connections.

251_118436_000021_000000.wav|'Even the arts you call sorcery are governed by cosmic laws,' answered the man in the green turban.

251_118436_000035_000008.wav|Quick-kill me, before they can trap my soul for ever!'
251_118436_000032_000007.wav|Their fingers sear me like fire!

251_118436_000023_000005.wav|Then the genuine lock travelled by camel caravan up the long, long road to Peshkhauri, thence up the Zhaibar Pass, until it reached the hands of those for whom it was intended.'
251_118436_000030_000001.wav|All the noble born fighting men of Ayodhya were gathered in the great palace or about it, and at each broad arched gate and door fifty archers stood on guard, with bows in their hands.
251_118436_000033_000002.wav|But the glassy blankness passed from his eyes like smoke blown from a fire, and he looked up at his sister with recognition.
251_118436_000006_000001.wav|Through the hot, stifling night the temple gongs boomed and the conchs roared.
251_118436_000018_000000.wav|'The people know he will never see another dawn,' this man answered.

251_118436_000011_000000.wav|She ceased as the king spoke; his livid lips did not move, and there was no recognition in his glassy eyes.
251_118436_000034_000000.wav|'Brother!' she sobbed.
251_118436_000037_000000.wav|'Swiftly, I command you!' There was the old imperious note in his failing whisper.

251_118436_000007_000000.wav|She threw up her head in a gusty gesture of wrath and despair as the thunder of the distant drums reached her ears.

251_118436_000011_000001.wav|But his voice rose in an eery call, indistinct and far away, as if called to her from beyond vast, wind blown gulfs.

2086_149220_000026_000001.wav|You mistake it for some other.
2086_149220_000030_000002.wav|His character perplexed the little country girl, as it might a more practised observer; for, while the tone of his conversation had generally been playful, the impression left on her mind was that of gravity, and, except as his youth modified it, almost sternness.

2086_149220_000006_000003.wav|Bees, too,--strange to say,--had thought it worth their while to come hither, possibly from the range of hives beside some farm house miles away.

Now, the remarkable point is, that the original wears, to the world's eye,--and, for aught I know, to his most intimate friends,--an exceedingly pleasant countenance, indicative of benevolence, openness of heart, sunny good humor, and other praiseworthy qualities of that cast.
2086_149220_000003_000002.wav|Three of the seven gables either fronted or looked sideways, with a dark solemnity of aspect, down into the garden.
2086_149220_000014_000002.wav|For you are a Pyncheon?"
2086_149220_000018_000005.wav|There is, at least, no flattery in my humble line of art.
2086_149220_000012_000002.wav|You are lucky to be in their good graces so soon!
2086_149220_000040_000001.wav|"These matches just glimmer, and go out."
2086_149220_000022_000003.wav|If the original is still in the world, I think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard."
2086_149220_000003_000001.wav|A hop vine, springing from last year's root, was beginning to clamber over it, but would be long in covering the roof with its green mantle.

2086_149220_000049_000000.wav|She retired to her chamber, but did not soon fall asleep, nor then very profoundly.
2086_149220_000037_000000.wav|"Shall I light a lamp, Cousin Hepzibah?" she asked.
2086_149220_000036_000002.wav|She was indistinctly aware, however, that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs, a little withdrawn from the window, the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek, turned sideways towards a corner.
2086_149220_000047_000003.wav|It has been my custom for more years, child, than you have lived!" While thus dismissing her, the maiden lady stept forward, kissed Phoebe, and pressed her to her heart, which beat against the girl's bosom with a strong, high, and tumultuous swell. How came there to be so much love in this desolate old heart, that it could afford to well over thus abundantly?
2086_149220_000039_000001.wav|How wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul!
2086_149220_000046_000000.wav|"My dear cousin," asked she, overcoming an indefinable reluctance, "is there not some one in the room with us?"
2086_149220_000030_000003.wav|She rebelled, as it were, against a certain magnetic element in the artist's nature, which he exercised towards her, possibly without being conscious of it.
2086_149220_000030_000000.wav|Silently, and rather surprised at her own compliance, Phoebe accordingly betook herself to weeding a flower bed, but busied herself still more with cogitations respecting this young man, with whom she so unexpectedly found herself on terms approaching to familiarity.
2086_149220_000004_000002.wav|Phoebe saw, however, that their growth must have been checked by a degree of careful labor, bestowed daily and systematically on the garden.
2086_149220_000006_000012.wav|All of them were pure specimens of a breed which had been transmitted down as an heirloom in the Pyncheon family, and were said, while in their prime, to have attained almost the size of turkeys, and, on the score of delicate flesh, to be fit for a prince's table.
2086_149220_000013_000000.wav|"The secret is," said Phoebe, smiling, "that I have learned how to talk with hens and chickens."
2086_149220_000016_000000.wav|"Yes," said Holgrave, "I dig, and hoe, and weed, in this black old earth, for the sake of refreshing myself with what little nature and simplicity may be left in it, after men have so long sown and reaped here.
2086_149220_000015_000000.wav|"My name is Phoebe Pyncheon," said the girl, with a manner of some reserve; for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the daguerreotypist, of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea.
2086_149220_000033_000000.wav|"Be careful not to drink at Maule's well!" said he.
2086_149220_000023_000001.wav|"I never did, but have a great curiosity to do so.
2086_149220_000045_000002.wav|The girl sat silently for a moment.
2086_149220_000016_000004.wav|It is like a bandage over one's eyes, to come into it.
2086_149220_000045_000003.wav|But soon, her senses being very acute, she became conscious of an irregular respiration in an obscure corner of the room. Her physical organization, moreover, being at once delicate and healthy, gave her a perception, operating with almost the effect of a spiritual medium, that somebody was near at hand.
2086_149220_000044_000000.wav|"No, child!" replied Hepzibah.
2086_149220_000021_000006.wav|At that mouth!
2086_149220_000006_000005.wav|Yet, late as it now was, there still arose a pleasant hum out of one or two of the squash blossoms, in the depths of which these bees were plying their golden labor.
2086_149220_000023_000000.wav|"You have seen that picture, then!" exclaimed the artist, with an expression of much interest.
2086_149220_000029_000001.wav|Coming fresh from country air and occupations, you will soon feel the need of some such out of door employment.
2086_149220_000029_000004.wav|So we will be fellow laborers, somewhat on the community system."
2086_149220_000027_000000.wav|"It will suit my purpose still better to see the original," replied the daguerreotypist coolly.
2086_149220_000027_000001.wav|"As to his character, we need not discuss its points; they have already been settled by a competent tribunal, or one which called itself competent.
2086_149220_000017_000000.wav|"A daguerreotype likeness, do you mean?" asked Phoebe with less reserve; for, in spite of prejudice, her own youthfulness sprang forward to meet his.
2086_149220_000042_000000.wav|She set the lighted lamp in the passage, and again entered the parlor. Hepzibah's form, though its sable outline mingled with the dusk, was now less imperfectly visible.
2086_149220_000006_000015.wav|It was evident that the race had degenerated, like many a noble race besides, in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure.
2086_149220_000026_000003.wav|Since you are a friend of my cousin Hepzibah's, you should ask her to show you the picture."
2086_149220_000006_000006.wav|There was one other object in the garden which Nature might fairly claim as her inalienable property, in spite of whatever man could do to render it his own.
2086_149220_000021_000003.wav|Here we have the man, sly, subtle, hard, imperious, and, withal, cold as ice.
2086_149220_000023_000002.wav|And you judge favorably of the face?"
2086_149220_000019_000000.wav|He exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case.
2086_149220_000004_000006.wav|Summer squashes almost in their golden blossom; cucumbers, now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock, and ramble far and wide; two or three rows of string beans and as many more that were about to festoon themselves on poles; tomatoes, occupying a site so sheltered and sunny that the plants were already gigantic, and promised an early and abundant harvest.
2086_149220_000041_000001.wav|It was strangely indistinct, however, and less like articulate words than an unshaped sound, such as would be the utterance of feeling and sympathy, rather than of the intellect.
2086_149220_000047_000001.wav|Pray go to bed; for I am sure you must need rest.
2086_149220_000021_000000.wav|"You would have seen other differences had you looked a little longer," said Holgrave, laughing, yet apparently much struck.
2086_149220_000036_000001.wav|On returning into Hepzibah's apartment of the house, she found the low studded parlor so dim and dusky that her eyes could not penetrate the interior.
2086_149220_000024_000000.wav|"There never was a sweeter one," said Phoebe.
2086_149220_000016_000003.wav|In short, I make pictures out of sunshine; and, not to be too much dazzled with my own trade, I have prevailed with Miss Hepzibah to let me lodge in one of these dusky gables.
2086_149220_000038_000002.wav|My eyes are weak; and I can seldom bear the lamplight on them."
2086_149220_000041_000000.wav|But, instead of a response from Hepzibah, she seemed to hear the murmur of an unknown voice.
2086_149220_000040_000000.wav|"In a moment, cousin!" answered the girl.
2086_149220_000021_000007.wav|Could it ever smile?
2086_149220_000017_000002.wav|They are conscious of looking very unamiable, I suppose, and therefore hate to be seen."
2086_149220_000027_000004.wav|I have a proposition to make you."
2086_149220_000012_000001.wav|"Those venerable personages in the coop, too, seem very affably disposed.
2086_149220_000045_000001.wav|There was a tremor in it, too, that-as all strong feeling is electric-partly communicated itself to Phoebe.
2086_149220_000006_000014.wav|Be that as it might, the hens were now scarcely larger than pigeons, and had a queer, rusty, withered aspect, and a gouty kind of movement, and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the variations of their clucking and cackling.
2086_149220_000018_000007.wav|Yet the original wears, to common eyes, a very different expression.
2086_149220_000035_000000.wav|"Oh," rejoined the daguerreotypist, "because, like an old lady's cup of tea, it is water bewitched!"
2086_149220_000005_000001.wav|Not surely her cousin Hepzibah's, who had no taste nor spirits for the lady like employment of cultivating flowers, and-with her recluse habits, and tendency to shelter herself within the dismal shadow of the house-would hardly have come forth under the speck of open sky to weed and hoe among the fraternity of beans and squashes.
2086_149220_000038_000000.wav|"Do, if you please, my dear child," answered Hepzibah.
2086_149220_000032_000001.wav|That last stroke of the hoe has cut off a beanstalk.
2086_149220_000016_000002.wav|My sober occupation, so far as I have any, is with a lighter material.
2086_149220_000006_000004.wav|How many aerial voyages might they have made, in quest of honey, or honey laden, betwixt dawn and sunset!
2086_149220_000021_000008.wav|And yet, if you could only see the benign smile of the original!
2086_149220_000020_000002.wav|To be sure, you have found some way of copying the portrait without its black velvet cap and gray beard, and have given him a modern coat and satin cravat, instead of his cloak and band.
2086_149220_000041_000002.wav|So vague was it, that its impression or echo in Phoebe's mind was that of unreality.
2086_149220_000014_000000.wav|"Ah, but these hens," answered the young man,--"these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn yard fowl.
2086_149220_000018_000002.wav|Most of my likenesses do look unamiable; but the very sufficient reason, I fancy, is, because the originals are so.
2086_149220_000048_000001.wav|"If you begin to love me, I am glad!"
2086_149220_000018_000000.wav|"If you would permit me," said the artist, looking at Phoebe, "I should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face.
2086_149220_000047_000002.wav|I will sit in the parlor awhile, and collect my thoughts.
2086_149220_000028_000001.wav|There was an odd kind of authority, too, in what he now proceeded to say, rather as if the garden were his own than a place to which he was admitted merely by Hepzibah's courtesy.
2086_149220_000030_000001.wav|She did not altogether like him.
2086_149220_000038_000001.wav|"But put it on the table in the corner of the passage.
2086_149220_000021_000004.wav|Look at that eye!
2086_149220_000034_000000.wav|"Maule's well!" answered Phoebe.
2086_149220_000022_000002.wav|But my cousin Hepzibah has another picture,--a miniature.
2086_149220_000047_000000.wav|"Phoebe, my dear little girl," said Hepzibah, after a moment's pause, "you were up betimes, and have been busy all day.
2086_149220_000015_000001.wav|"I did not know that my cousin Hepzibah's garden was under another person's care."
2086_149220_000026_000002.wav|A crime, indeed!
2086_149220_000024_000001.wav|"It is almost too soft and gentle for a man's."
2086_149220_000041_000003.wav|She concluded that she must have mistaken some other sound for that of the human voice; or else that it was altogether in her fancy.
2086_149220_000026_000000.wav|"It is nonsense," said Phoebe a little impatiently, "for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen.
2086_149220_000042_000001.wav|In the remoter parts of the room, however, its walls being so ill adapted to reflect light, there was nearly the same obscurity as before.
2086_149214_000006_000003.wav|When romances do really teach anything, or produce any effective operation, it is usually through a far more subtile process than the ostensible one.
2086_149214_000004_000003.wav|If he think fit, also, he may so manage his atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture.
2086_149214_000004_000002.wav|The former-while, as a work of art, it must rigidly subject itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart-has fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances, to a great extent, of the writer's own choosing or creation.
2086_149214_000005_000001.wav|The point of view in which this tale comes under the Romantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that is flitting away from us.
2086_149214_000005_000003.wav|The narrative, it may be, is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage, and, at the same time, to render it the more difficult of attainment.
2086_149214_000004_000005.wav|He can hardly be said, however, to commit a literary crime even if he disregard this caution.
2086_149214_000006_000005.wav|A high truth, indeed, fairly, finely, and skilfully wrought out, brightening at every step, and crowning the final development of a work of fiction, may add an artistic glory, but is never any truer, and seldom any more evident, at the last page than at the first.
2086_149214_000005_000002.wav|It is a legend prolonging itself, from an epoch now gray in the distance, down into our own broad daylight, and bringing along with it some of its legendary mist, which the reader, according to his pleasure, may either disregard, or allow it to float almost imperceptibly about the characters and events for the sake of a picturesque effect.
2086_149214_000004_000000.wav|WHEN a writer calls his work a Romance, it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude, both as to its fashion and material, which he would not have felt himself entitled to assume had he professed to be writing a Novel.
2086_149214_000006_000002.wav|In good faith, however, he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind.
2086_149214_000007_000000.wav|The reader may perhaps choose to assign an actual locality to the imaginary events of this narrative.
2086_149214_000006_000004.wav|The author has considered it hardly worth his while, therefore, relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rod,--or, rather, as by sticking a pin through a butterfly,--thus at once depriving it of life, and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude.
2086_149214_000004_000004.wav|He will be wise, no doubt, to make a very moderate use of the privileges here stated, and, especially, to mingle the Marvelous rather as a slight, delicate, and evanescent flavor, than as any portion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the public.
2086_149214_000006_000000.wav|Many writers lay very great stress upon some definite moral purpose, at which they profess to aim their works.
2086_149214_000007_000001.wav|If permitted by the historical connection,--which, though slight, was essential to his plan,--the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature.
2412_153954_000006_000001.wav|The country was highly cultivated, every ledge being planted with chestnuts, walnuts, and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering.
2412_153954_000008_000001.wav|He looked me all over for about five minutes, letting his eyes wander from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, up and down, and down and up; neither did his mind seem in the least clearer when he had done looking than when he began.
2412_153954_000008_000009.wav|As soon as it was ended, they proceeded to overhaul my swag and the contents of my pockets.
2412_153954_000009_000001.wav|When I had shown them what I did with it, they were astonished but not displeased, and seemed to like the smell.
2412_153954_000002_000007.wav|My guides spoke to many in passing, and those spoken to showed much amazement.
2412_153954_000002_000004.wav|However, I showed no sign of wonder or disapproval; for I remembered that to be all things to all men was one of the injunctions of the Gentile Apostle, which for the present I should do well to heed.
2412_153954_000010_000000.wav|I remember that when they first found it I had thought of Paley, and how he tells us that a savage on seeing a watch would at once conclude that it was designed.
2412_153954_000006_000002.wav|Goats were abundant; also a kind of small black cattle, in the marshes near the river, which was now fast widening, and running between larger flats from which the hills receded more and more.
2412_153954_000008_000003.wav|He appeared more and more puzzled, and then retired, returning with two others much like himself.
2412_153954_000002_000002.wav|Sometimes we went through forests of pine, or rather yew trees, though they looked like pine; and I remember that now and again we passed a little wayside shrine, wherein there would be a statue of great beauty, representing some figure, male or female, in the very heyday of youth, strength, and beauty, or of the most dignified maturity and old age.
2412_153954_000008_000011.wav|At least I fancied so, but I soon found my mistake.
2412_153954_000009_000002.wav|But by and by they came to my watch, which I had hidden away in the inmost pocket that I had, and had forgotten when they began their search.
2412_153954_000004_000004.wav|I was dazzled as I saw one after the other, of whom I could only feel that each was the loveliest I had ever seen.
2412_153954_000002_000003.wav|My hosts always bowed their heads as they passed one of these shrines, and it shocked me to see statues that had no apparent object, beyond the chronicling of some unusual individual excellence or beauty, receive so serious a homage.
2412_153954_000002_000006.wav|But it was not so.
2412_153954_000007_000001.wav|I will spare the reader any description of the town, and would only bid him think of Domodossola or Faido.
2412_153954_000005_000005.wav|I could fill many pages with a description of their dress and the ornaments which they wore, and a hundred details which struck me with all the force of novelty; but I must not stay to do so.
2412_153954_000004_000002.wav|Their colour was equal to that of the finest Italian paintings; being of the clearest olive, and yet ruddy with a glow of perfect health.
2412_153954_000013_000000.wav|We passed many cases, and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches.
2412_153954_000003_000000.wav|The village was just like the one we had left, only rather larger.
2412_153954_000004_000003.wav|Their expression was divine; and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment, I forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly.
2412_153954_000007_000004.wav|The other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self-contained, and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him.
2412_153954_000007_000006.wav|These two were first called out; and in about a quarter of an hour I was made to follow them, which I did in some fear, and with much curiosity.
2412_153954_000004_000000.wav|Lastly, I should say that the people were of a physical beauty which was simply amazing.

2412_153954_000012_000005.wav|As I said before, all were marred and broken.
2412_153954_000008_000006.wav|They even pulled down my eyelids, and looked, I suppose, to see if they were bloodshot; but it was not so.
2412_153954_000004_000001.wav|I never saw anything in the least comparable to them. The women were vigorous, and had a most majestic gait, their heads being set upon their shoulders with a grace beyond all power of expression. Each feature was finished, eyelids, eyelashes, and ears being almost invariably perfect.
2412_153954_000006_000000.wav|When we had got past the village the fog rose, and revealed magnificent views of the snowy mountains and their nearer abutments, while in front I could now and again catch glimpses of the great plains which I had surveyed on the preceding evening.
2412_153954_000007_000005.wav|Both of them appeared astonished at seeing one who was evidently a stranger, but they were too ill to come up to me, and form conclusions concerning me.
2412_153954_000007_000003.wav|In fact, one of them was plainly very much out of health, and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it.
2412_153954_000008_000010.wav|This gave me little uneasiness, for I had no money with me, nor anything which they were at all likely to want, or which I cared about losing.

2412_153954_000005_000000.wav|The men were as handsome as the women beautiful.
2412_153954_000013_000002.wav|The design was different, but the thing was clearly the same.
2412_153954_000002_000009.wav|I may as well say at once what my after experience taught me-namely, that with all their faults and extraordinary obliquity of mental vision upon many subjects, they are the very best bred people that I ever fell in with.
2412_153954_000009_000003.wav|They seemed concerned and uneasy as soon as they got hold of it.
2412_153954_000008_000005.wav|They felt my pulse, they looked at my tongue, they listened at my chest, they felt all my muscles; and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded, and said something in a tone quite pleasant, as though I were all right.
2412_153954_000007_000000.wav|In about four hours of walking from the time we started, and after passing two or three more villages, we came upon a considerable town, and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something, but I gathered no inkling of their meaning, except that I need be under no apprehension of danger.
2412_153954_000005_000002.wav|The children were infinite in number, and exceedingly merry; I need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty.
2412_153954_000004_000005.wav|Even in middle age they were still comely, and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity, not to say majesty, of their own.
2412_153954_000005_000001.wav|I have always delighted in and reverenced beauty; but I felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type-a compound of all that is best in Egyptian, Greek and Italian.
2412_153954_000011_000001.wav|He spoke to me solemnly and sternly for two or three minutes.
2412_153954_000008_000002.wav|He at length asked me a single short question, which I supposed meant "Who are you?" I answered in English quite composedly as though he would understand me, and endeavoured to be my very most natural self as well as I could.
2412_153954_000013_000001.wav|Here the magistrate stopped, and opening the case began comparing my watch with the others.
2412_153954_000006_000003.wav|I saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails. Dogs were there in plenty, and very English; but I saw no cats, nor indeed are these creatures known, their place being supplied by a sort of small terrier.
2412_153954_000002_000000.wav|We followed an Alpine path for some four miles, now hundreds of feet above a brawling stream which descended from the glaciers, and now nearly alongside it.
2412_153954_000003_000003.wav|It was here as hitherto: all things were generically the same as in Europe, the differences being of species only; and I was amused at seeing in a window some bottles with barley sugar and sweetmeats for children, as at home; but the barley sugar was in plates, not in twisted sticks, and was coloured blue.
2412_153954_000012_000001.wav|The larger specimens had a case to themselves, and tickets with writing on them in a character which I could not understand.
2412_153954_000003_000004.wav|Glass was plentiful in the better houses.
2412_153954_000002_000001.wav|The morning was cold and somewhat foggy, for the autumn had made great strides latterly.
2412_153948_000011_000003.wav|I had a telescope and a dog, and would take bread and meat and tobacco with me. Starting with early dawn, it would be night before I could complete my round; for the mountain over which I had to go was very high.
2412_153948_000015_000004.wav|This would be the highest triumph that I could wish for; but it was too much to think of yet.
2412_153948_000009_000003.wav|Men pushed farther and farther into the mountains, and found a very considerable tract inside the front range, between it and another which was loftier still, though even this was not the highest, the great snowy one which could be seen from out upon the plains.
2412_153948_000003_000001.wav|Suffice it, that when I left home it was with the intention of going to some new colony, and either finding, or even perhaps purchasing, waste crown land suitable for cattle or sheep farming, by which means I thought that I could better my fortunes more rapidly than in England.
2412_153948_000015_000006.wav|Even if I did not find country, might I not find gold, or diamonds, or copper, or silver?
2412_153948_000015_000003.wav|Could I hope to cross it?
2412_153948_000013_000006.wav|Alas! they are both mistaken; the ewe is not the lamb's ewe, they are neither kin nor kind to one another, and part in coldness.
2412_153948_000015_000005.wav|I would try the nearer range, and see how far I could go.
2412_153948_000008_000002.wav|The climate was temperate, and very healthy; there were no wild animals, nor were the natives dangerous, being few in number and of an intelligent tractable disposition.
2412_153948_000013_000002.wav|wonderful!
2412_153948_000007_000001.wav|The colony was one which had not been opened up even to the most adventurous settlers for more than eight or nine years, having been previously uninhabited, save by a few tribes of savages who frequented the seaboard.
2412_153948_000012_000004.wav|I knew that there was a range still farther back; but except from one place near the very top of my own mountain, no part of it was visible: from this point, however, I saw, whenever there were no clouds, a single snow clad peak, many miles away, and I should think about as high as any mountain in the world.
2412_153948_000015_000001.wav|Ah! who could say?
2412_153948_000013_000005.wav|Aha! they see, and rush towards each other.
2412_153947_000017_000006.wav|Then I had much pleasure in reading it, but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books, in spite of their entire independence to one another.

2412_153947_000017_000001.wav|This is a mistake, though a perfectly natural one.
2412_153947_000017_000005.wav|On my return, I purposely avoided looking into it until I had sent back my last revises to the printer.
2412_153947_000014_000000.wav|The Author wishes it to be understood that Erewhon is pronounced as a word of three syllables, all short-thus, E re whon.
2412_153947_000020_000004.wav|I have also parted with the word "infortuniam" (though not without regret), but have not dared to meddle with other similar inaccuracies.
2412_153947_000034_000000.wav|Having now, I fear, at too great length done what I was asked to do, I should like to add a few words on my own account.
2412_153947_000029_000000.wav|The next part of "Erewhon" that I wrote was the "World of the Unborn," a preliminary form of which was sent to mr Holyoake's paper, but as I cannot find it among those copies of the Reasoner that are in the British Museum, I conclude that it was not accepted.
2412_153947_000030_000000.wav|I also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the Musical Banks, and the trial of a man for being in a consumption.
3752_4943_000006_000000.wav|"I'm not to go in there?" says the ex bank clerk, drawing back in dismay from the cloud of foul faces which lowered upon him.
3752_4943_000054_000003.wav|"Tried to bolt, eh!
3752_4943_000020_000000.wav|"Can't sir, without an order from the Commandant."
3752_4943_000061_000000.wav|Kirkland was put into a separate cell that night; and Troke, by way of assuring him a good night's rest, told him that he was to have "fifty" in the morning.
3752_4943_000054_000000.wav|Kirkland only breathed harder, and looked round for mr North, but mr North had gone.
3752_4943_000039_000000.wav|"Oh," he said, "that such a wretch as I should live!"
3752_4943_000054_000006.wav|Tell Macklewain to be ready-or stay, I'll tell him myself-I'll break the young devil's spirit, blank him."
3752_4943_000009_000001.wav|Get in." So Kirkland, aged twenty two, and the son of Methodist parents, went in.
3752_4943_000027_000000.wav|The Commandant, roused from slumber, told mr North that Kirkland might stop where he was, and that he'd thank the chaplain not to wake him up in the middle of the night because a blank prisoner set up a blank howling.
3752_4943_000016_000002.wav|Oh, mr North!
3752_4943_000052_000000.wav|"Oh, mr North," says Kirkland, "why did you stop me?
3752_4943_000045_000000.wav|"I suppose so.
3752_4943_000021_000000.wav|"I order you, sir!" North cried, indignant.
3752_4943_000045_000001.wav|What does he care?"
3752_4943_000013_000000.wav|"A prisoner refractory, your reverence," said the watchman.
3752_4943_000051_000001.wav|"You'll see if you won't remember this day."
3752_4943_000054_000004.wav|Must stop that.
3752_4943_000018_000001.wav|For God's sake, mr North!" and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands.
3752_4943_000055_000000.wav|"Yes, sir," said Troke.
3752_4943_000050_000003.wav|Kirkland jumped for the jetty, missed his footing, and fell into the arms of the chaplain.
3752_4943_000019_000000.wav|"Let him out, watchman!" said North.
3752_4943_000029_000000.wav|"Impertinent young beggar!" said Burgess.
3752_4943_000059_000001.wav|I won't have my men knocked up with flogging these rascals.

3752_4943_000010_000001.wav|So fierce was the glamour of the place, however, that when locked into his cell, he felt ashamed for that sigh, and strove to erase the memory of it.
3752_4943_000022_000002.wav|"Would you see me perish, body and soul, in this place?
3752_4943_000041_000000.wav|The work of the gang that afternoon was the carrying of some heavy logs to the water side, and Rufus Dawes observed that Kirkland was exhausted long before the task was accomplished.
3752_4943_000040_000002.wav|March!"
3752_4943_000010_000000.wav|Rufus Dawes, among whose sinister memories this yard was numbered, sighed.
3752_4943_000043_000000.wav|Rufus Dawes nodded.
3752_4943_000051_000000.wav|"You young vermin-you shall pay for this," cries Troke.
3752_4943_000016_000003.wav|Oh, for God's sake, mr North!"
3752_4943_000022_000001.wav|North!" screamed Kirkland.
3752_4943_000003_000011.wav|I'll blank soon cure you of that!" and forthwith ordered him to the chain gang for "insubordination".
3752_4943_000054_000005.wav|Fifty lashes, Troke.
3752_4943_000011_000000.wav|About dawn the next morning, mr North-who, amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop, had a habit of prowling about the prison at unofficial hours-was attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory.
3752_4943_000033_000001.wav|His face was of a greenish tint, and wore an expression of bewildered horror.
3752_4943_000029_000002.wav|mr North, I'm sorry you should have had the trouble to come here, but will you let me go to sleep?"
3752_4943_000047_000000.wav|He had hardly uttered the words, when the boy flung himself beneath the log.
3752_4943_000016_000000.wav|"Oh, mr North!
3752_4943_000056_000002.wav|His flogging wouldn't have killed a flea."
3752_4943_000026_000001.wav|"There's more trouble with you bloody aristocrats than enough.
3752_4943_000023_000000.wav|"Let him out!" cried North again, stamping his foot.
3752_4943_000032_000001.wav|"Poor young chap!
3752_4943_000024_000002.wav|If he was dying, I can't."
3752_4943_000026_000002.wav|Lie quiet!"
3752_4943_000012_000000.wav|"What's the matter here?" he asked.
3752_4943_000003_000010.wav|"You blank blank, is that your blank game?
3752_4943_000035_000000.wav|"What do they do if you try to bolt?" whispered Kirkland.
3752_4943_000053_000001.wav|"Your blessed hide'll feel for this, see if it don't."
3752_4943_000030_000000.wav|North returned to the prison disconsolately, found the dutiful Hailes at his post, and all quiet.
3752_4943_000033_000000.wav|In the morning, Rufus Dawes, coming to his place on the chain gang, was struck by the altered appearance of Kirkland.
3752_4943_000042_000000.wav|"Have you ever been in that-that place I was in last night?" asked Kirkland.
3752_4943_000055_000001.wav|"Good evening, sir."
3752_4943_000028_000000.wav|"But, my good sir," protested North, restraining his impulse to overstep the bounds of modesty in his language to his superior officer, "you know the character of the men in that ward.
3752_4943_000058_000000.wav|"They won't do it."
3752_4943_000050_000001.wav|But Kirkland kept steadily on for the river.
3752_4943_000029_000001.wav|"Do him good, curse him!
3752_4943_000037_000000.wav|"Thank God!" said Kirkland.
3752_4943_000032_000000.wav|"Fretted hisself to sleep, yer reverence," said Hailes, in accents of parental concern.
3752_4943_000008_000000.wav|"But, mr Troke-"
3752_4943_000015_000000.wav|Kirkland, ghastly pale, bleeding, with his woollen shirt torn, and his blue eyes wide open with terror, was clinging to the bars.
3752_4943_000003_000005.wav|So, doubtless, it was, and might have been, had not an untoward accident occurred.
3752_4943_000003_000003.wav|He had been a clerk in a banking house, and was transported for embezzlement, though, by some, grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained.
3752_4943_000005_000000.wav|The toil was severe, and the companionship uncouth, but despite his blistered hands and aching back, he had not experienced anything so very terrible after all.
3752_4943_000024_000001.wav|"I can't.
3752_4943_000022_000004.wav|Oh, you ministers of Christ-wolves in sheep's clothing-you shall be judged for this!"
3752_4943_000050_000000.wav|"Halt! you young fool," roared Troke, raising his carbine.
3752_4943_000017_000000.wav|"What, Kirkland!" cried North, who was ignorant of the vengeance of the Commandant.
3752_4943_000048_000000.wav|"Hold on to me, Miss Nancy," said the giant, "I'm big enough to carry double."
3752_4943_000031_000000.wav|"What's become of Kirkland?" he asked.
3752_4943_000056_000001.wav|That last fellow you had ought to have been tied up himself.
3752_4943_000059_000002.wav|If the scourger won't do his duty, tie him up, and give him five and twenty for himself.
3752_4943_000014_000000.wav|"mr North!
3752_4943_000022_000003.wav|mr North!
3752_4943_000040_000000.wav|"Silence!" cried Troke.
3752_4943_000046_000002.wav|Hold up, my lad.
3752_4943_000022_000000.wav|"Very sorry, your reverence; but your reverence knows that I daren't do such a thing." "mr
3752_4943_000038_000000.wav|"Now then, Miss Nancy," said one of the men, "what's the matter with you!" Kirkland shuddered, and his pale face grew crimson.
3752_4943_000018_000000.wav|But Kirkland could do nothing but cry,--"Oh, mr North!
3752_4943_000028_000001.wav|You can guess what that unhappy boy has suffered."
3752_4943_000046_000003.wav|If you fall, we must fall over you, and then you're done for."
3752_4943_000034_000000.wav|"Cheer up, man!" said Dawes, touched with momentary pity.
3752_4943_000059_000003.wav|I'll be down in the morning myself if I can."
3752_4943_000013_000001.wav|"Wants to come out."
3752_4943_000036_000000.wav|"Kill you," returned Dawes, in a tone of surprise at so preposterous a question.
3752_4943_000054_000002.wav|Troke reported the ex bank clerk that night to Burgess, and Burgess, who was about to go to dinner with the new chaplain, disposed of his case out of hand.
3752_4943_000009_000000.wav|"Stow your gaff," says Troke, with another oath, and impatiently striking the lad with his thong-"I can't argue here all night.
3752_4943_000041_000002.wav|"What have you been doing to get into this scrape?"
3752_4943_000003_000007.wav|Kirkland belonged to a Methodist family and owned a piety utterly out of place in that region.
3752_4943_000050_000002.wav|Just as he reached it, however, the figure of mr North rose from behind a pile of stones.
3752_4943_000056_000000.wav|"Troke-pick out some likely man, will you?
3752_4943_000003_000002.wav|His name was Kirkland, and he belonged to what were known as the "educated" prisoners.
3752_4943_000025_000000.wav|North rushed away to the Commandant, and the instant his back was turned, Hailes, the watchman, flung open the door, and darted into the dormitory.
3752_4943_000014_000001.wav|mr North!" cried a voice, "for the love of God, let me out of this place!"
3752_4944_000027_000002.wav|He saved her life, you know."
3752_4944_000061_000001.wav|"The condition of those dormitories is infamous."
3752_4944_000063_000002.wav|Besides, he's not the sort of creature to complain.
3752_4944_000070_000003.wav|How delightful the grass smells!
3752_4944_000023_000000.wav|"Miss Vickers, a charming young person.
3752_4944_000101_000000.wav|He had no cancer.
3752_4944_000035_000000.wav|"It's a punishment for brutes," said Burgess, and laughed, pleased with the nearest approach to an epigram he ever made in his life.
3752_4944_000028_000001.wav|"We've got the fellows here, you know."
3752_4944_000097_000005.wav|It relieved him for a while.
3752_4944_000046_000001.wav|"Macklewain, have a glass of wine." But Macklewain was tired, and wanted to get home.
3752_4944_000076_000001.wav|The lad has been cruelly punished already.
3752_4944_000100_000005.wav|Still he could not sleep.
3752_4944_000058_000002.wav|I wonder Burgess didn't give him a hundred."
3752_4944_000074_000000.wav|"Captain Burgess, Macklewain tells me you are going to flog Kirkland."
3752_4944_000070_000005.wav|Good night."
3752_4944_000088_000002.wav|He made a stride towards the Commandant, as though to seize him by the throat, but, checking himself in time, stood still, with clenched hands, flashing eyes, and beard that bristled.
3752_4944_000077_000001.wav|I'll teach my prisoners to attempt suicide!"
3752_4944_000098_000000.wav|"I must keep my wits for to morrow.
3752_4944_000051_000002.wav|"Up at daylight, I suppose, again."
3752_4944_000039_000000.wav|The Reverend Meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror.
3752_4944_000062_000000.wav|"If the boy has anything to complain of, why don't he complain?
3752_4944_000072_000001.wav|Good night, once more."
3752_4944_000050_000000.wav|"No?
3752_4944_000087_000000.wav|"Damn your impertinence, sir!" burst out Burgess.
3752_4944_000014_000002.wav|"Pray help yourself to wine."
3752_4944_000037_000000.wav|"Nothing," said North, recovering himself with an effort.
3752_4944_000053_000000.wav|"That young butler fellow of his." "What, Kirkland?" cried North.
3752_4944_000065_000000.wav|"I'll go back and see Burgess," said North.
3752_4944_000020_000000.wav|"Frere!
3752_4944_000100_000003.wav|He raised it to his lips and eagerly drank.
3752_4944_000061_000000.wav|"If Burgess flogs him I'll report it to the Governor," cries North, in great heat.
3752_4944_000100_000008.wav|He saw its amber fluid sparkle. He heard it gurgle as he poured it out.
3752_4944_000008_000002.wav|I doubt-forgive me for expressing myself so freely-if you quite know of our convict system."
3752_4944_000066_000002.wav|Everything must give way to that.
3752_4944_000013_000000.wav|"Or like Sancho Panza's island," said North.
3752_4944_000065_000001.wav|"mr Meekin, here's the gate, and your room is on the right hand.
3752_4944_000068_000001.wav|Macklewain shook his head seriously.
3752_4944_000077_000000.wav|"Well, that's just what I'm flogging him for.
3752_4944_000053_000001.wav|"You don't mean to say he's going to flog Kirkland?"
3752_4944_000098_000002.wav|Meekin, too, will suspect.
3752_4944_000070_000002.wav|"Ah! Doctor, we all have our crosses, have we not?
3752_4944_000014_000000.wav|"Not at this moment, sir," said Burgess, with dignity.
3752_4944_000100_000001.wav|He reached it at length, and opening the cupboard, pulled out what he sought.
3752_4944_000011_000003.wav|Burgess-desirous, perhaps, of favourably impressing the chaplain whom the Bishop delighted to honour-shut off his blasphemy for a while, and was urbane enough.
3752_4944_000064_000002.wav|I can't help it.
3752_4944_000086_000001.wav|I am a minister of God, sir, and I forbid you to commit this crime."
3752_4944_000058_000001.wav|"A nice example to set.
3752_4944_000002_000001.wav|mr NORTH'S DISPOSITION.
3752_4944_000025_000000.wav|"Captain Frere takes a deep interest in all relating to convict discipline," went on Meekin, unheeding the interruption, "and is anxious that mrs Frere should see this place."
3752_4944_000099_000000.wav|He went into his bedroom and flung himself on the bed, but only to toss from side to side.
3752_4944_000072_000000.wav|"And let us hope poor mr North will succeed in his labour of love," said Meekin, shutting the little gate, "and save the unfortunate Kirkland.
3752_4944_000020_000001.wav|I should say so!" returned Burgess, with a laugh, modelled upon Maurice Frere's own.
3752_4944_000096_000001.wav|"Oh, God, give me strength!
3752_4944_000073_000000.wav|Captain Burgess was shutting his verandah window when North hurried up.
3752_4944_000095_000008.wav|"Fool that I am."
3752_4944_000054_000001.wav|"Fifty lashes."
3752_4944_000004_000000.wav|"I thought it was a little paradise," said Meekin.
3752_4944_000047_000000.wav|"I must also be thinking of repose," said Meekin; "the journey-though most enjoyable-has fatigued me."
3752_4944_000076_000002.wav|He attempted suicide to day-unhappy creature."
3752_4944_000078_000001.wav|He's too weak."
3752_4944_000079_000000.wav|"That's Macklewain's business."
3752_4944_000055_000001.wav|"He can't stand it.
3752_4944_000100_000011.wav|He wept, he prayed, he fought with his desire as with a madness.
3752_4944_000009_000003.wav|It is so complete."
3752_4944_000003_000001.wav|"It has made me heartsick."
3752_4944_000058_000000.wav|mr Meekin expressed some alarm; but dr Macklewain re assured him. "That sort of nonsense must be stopped," said he.
3752_4944_000100_000007.wav|He saw in the darkness the brandy bottle-vulgar and terrible apparition!
3752_4944_000019_000000.wav|"Do you know Captain Frere?"
3752_4944_000039_000001.wav|The Reverend Meekin was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties, smoked clay pipes, chewed tobacco, and drank neat brandy out of tumblers.
3752_4944_000044_000000.wav|"Well, how's Forrest?" cried Burgess.
3752_4944_000096_000000.wav|Then he began to walk up and down, to fling himself on the sofa, to read, to pray.
3752_4944_000097_000004.wav|He mixed a teaspoonful of this in a pannikin of water and drank it.
3752_4944_000096_000004.wav|I struggle, but I am weak.
3752_4944_000033_000000.wav|"Oh! there's no fear of him," said Burgess cheerily; "if he grows uproarious, we'll soon give him a touch of the cat."
3752_4944_000046_000000.wav|"Confound it-another of my best men," grumbled Burgess.
3752_4944_000031_000000.wav|"Well now!" said Meekin, with asperity, "I don't agree with you. Everybody seems to be against that poor fellow-Captain Frere tried to make me think that his letters contained a hidden meaning, but I don't believe they did.
3752_4944_000097_000003.wav|He got up at length, went into the kitchen, and found a packet of red pepper.
3752_4944_000021_000001.wav|He is just married, you know."
3752_4944_000069_000001.wav|He has the strangest fits at times.
3752_4944_000097_000000.wav|To see him rolling on the sofa in agony, to see his white face, his parched lips, and his contracted brow, to hear his moans and muttered prayers, one would have thought him suffering from the pangs of some terrible disease.
3752_4944_000056_000000.wav|"Perhaps you'll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that," returned Macklewain, drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature.
3752_4944_000057_000001.wav|He tried to drown himself this morning."
3752_4944_000084_000000.wav|"Do you persist in having this boy flogged?"
3752_4944_000027_000001.wav|A romantic story, Captain Burgess.
3752_4944_000015_000002.wav|Meekin-ever softly at his ease-was the first to speak.
3752_4944_000097_000001.wav|He opened the book again, and forced himself to read, but his eyes wandered to the cupboard.
3752_4944_000099_000003.wav|It was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force. "I must have a teaspoonful," he said, "to allay the craving."
3752_4944_000063_000003.wav|He'd rather kill himself."
3752_4944_000099_000002.wav|Sleep would not come to him.
3752_4944_000052_000000.wav|"Whom is he going to flog now?"
3752_4944_000038_000001.wav|No, I say.
3752_4944_000100_000006.wav|The taste of the liquor maddened him for more.
3752_4944_000015_000001.wav|"I have a headache." His manner of speech and action was so awkward that a silence fell upon the party, caused by each one wondering why mr North should grow confused, and drum his fingers on the table, and stare everywhere but at the decanter.
3752_4944_000008_000000.wav|mr North sighed again.
3752_4944_000022_000002.wav|I heard something about it, too."
3752_4944_000083_000000.wav|"Then don't you interfere with me, sir."
3752_4944_000049_000000.wav|"You won't have a nip of brandy before you start?" asked Burgess.
3752_4944_000038_000000.wav|"No, no, it will pass.
3752_4944_000011_000000.wav|"If you please," said Meekin gravely.
3752_4944_000095_000003.wav|I'll report this to the Government.
3752_4944_000042_000001.wav|The Reverend mr North, in this cool atmosphere, seemed to recover himself, and conversation progressed with some sprightliness.
3752_4944_000095_000001.wav|"They shall not flog that boy," he said.
3752_4944_000096_000003.wav|Help me!
3752_4944_000071_000000.wav|"Good night, sir.
3752_4944_000036_000000.wav|Here attention was called by the strange behaviour of mr North.
3752_4944_000100_000013.wav|That, at all times debasing, at this particular time it was infamous; that a vice, unworthy of any man, was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of God.
3752_4944_000008_000001.wav|"You have not been long in the colony, mr Meekin.
3752_4944_000042_000000.wav|So they went on to the verandah, and looked down upon the lights of the prison, and listened to the sea lapping the shore.
3752_4944_000011_000004.wav|"You'll find us rough, mr Meekin," he said, "but you'll find us 'all there' when we're wanted. This is a little kingdom in itself."
3752_4944_000034_000001.wav|It is a brutal punishment."
3752_4944_000069_000000.wav|"There is something wrong about him, but I can't make out what it is.
3752_4944_000030_000000.wav|"A great rascal," put in North.
3752_4944_000094_000000.wav|"The Government may go to----, and you, too!" roared Burgess.
3752_4944_000031_000001.wav|He seems to me to be truly penitent for his offences-a misguided, but not a hypocritical man, if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything."
3752_4944_000089_000000.wav|The two men looked at each other, and presently Burgess's eyes fell before those of the chaplain.
3752_4944_000082_000000.wav|"Captain Burgess, you have no right to mock at my office."
3752_4944_000069_000002.wav|Unless it's a cancer in the stomach, I don't know what it can be."
3752_4944_000088_000000.wav|This, of course, was mere bravado on the part of the Commandant.
3752_4944_000010_000001.wav|"Yes, it is very complete," he said; "almost too complete.
3752_4944_000099_000001.wav|In vain he repeated texts of Scripture and scraps of verse; in vain counted imaginary sheep, or listened to imaginary clock tickings.
3752_4944_000062_000001.wav|We can't do anything without evidence."
3752_4944_000044_000001.wav|"mr Meekin-dr
3752_4944_000063_000000.wav|"Complain!
3752_4944_000040_000000.wav|"Ha!" said North, looking wildly round upon them.
3752_4944_000067_000000.wav|"Yes, yes.
3752_4944_000093_000000.wav|"I'll report this to the Government," said North, aghast.
3752_4944_000009_000000.wav|"An admirable one!
3752_4944_000081_000000.wav|"Look here, mr North, I don't interfere with what you do to the prisoner's souls; don't you interfere with what I do to their bodies."
3752_4944_000007_000002.wav|His staff, you know, mr North.
3752_4944_000004_000001.wav|"Captain Frere says that the scenery is delightful." "So it is," returned North, looking askance, "but the prisoners are not delightful."
3752_4944_000016_000001.wav|Sometimes a party comes over with a recommendation from the Governor, and I show them over the place; but, as a rule, we see no one but ourselves."
3752_4944_000016_000000.wav|"Very few.
3752_4944_000032_000001.wav|"I wouldn't trust him."
3752_4944_000040_000001.wav|"That's better."
3752_4944_000027_000000.wav|"So Captain Frere thinks.
3752_4944_000032_000000.wav|"I hope he is," said North.
3752_4944_000059_000000.wav|"He was put into the long dormitory," said North; "you know what sort of a place that is.
3752_4944_000050_000002.wav|Good night.
3752_4944_000091_000000.wav|Burgess, white with rage, rang the bell that summoned his convict servant.
3752_4944_000070_000001.wav|dear me, how dreadful!" says Meekin.
3752_4944_000034_000000.wav|"I suppose severity is necessary," returned Meekin; "though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful.
3752_4944_000065_000002.wav|I'll be back shortly."
3752_4944_000064_000003.wav|The boy's made his bed, and he must lie on it."
3752_4944_000050_000003.wav|Macklewain, I want to speak with you a moment."
3752_4944_000093_000001.wav|"This is murderous."
3752_4944_000080_000001.wav|I have seen him, and his condition of mind is pitiable."
3752_4944_000020_000002.wav|"I was quartered with him at Sarah Island.
3752_4944_000005_000001.wav|How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon that bank!
3752_4944_000009_000002.wav|"There were a few matters I noticed in Hobart Town that did not quite please me-the frequent use of profane language for instance-but on the whole I was delighted with the scheme.
3752_4944_000037_000001.wav|"A spasm.
3752_4944_000071_000001.wav|I hope you will be comfortable."
3752_4944_000100_000015.wav|In the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard, with the bottle at his lips, in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible.
3752_4944_000057_000000.wav|"My dear sir," replied North, alive to the importance of conciliating the surgeon, "you haven't seen him lately.
3752_4944_000006_000000.wav|"Abandoned, indeed, by God and man-almost."
3752_4944_000023_000001.wav|They are going to Sydney, where Captain Frere has some interest, and Frere thinks of taking Port Arthur on his way down."
3752_4944_000066_000003.wav|I shall find my portmanteau in my room, you said."
3752_4944_000088_000001.wav|North knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence, but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip.
3752_4944_000002_000000.wav|CHAPTER fourteen.
3752_4944_000075_000000.wav|"Well, sir, what of that?" said Burgess.
3752_4944_000080_000000.wav|"Captain Burgess," protested North, "I assure you that he does not deserve punishment.
3752_4944_000086_000000.wav|"Then, Captain Burgess," cried North, his pale face flushing, "I tell you the boy's blood will be on your head.
3752_4944_000095_000000.wav|North returned home in great agitation.
3752_4944_000011_000002.wav|The dinner went off successfully.
3752_4944_000029_000000.wav|"I saw them tried at Hobart Town," said Meekin.
3752_4944_000015_000000.wav|"Thank you, none," said North, filling a tumbler with water.
3752_4944_000097_000002.wav|There lurked something that fascinated him.
3752_4944_000036_000002.wav|"Hullo, North! what's the matter?"
3752_4944_000010_000000.wav|North pursed up his lips.
3752_4944_000022_000001.wav|"The devil he is!
3752_4944_000055_000000.wav|"Oh, this must be stopped," cried North, in great alarm.
3752_4944_000087_000001.wav|"You're a dismissed officer of the Government, sir.
3752_4944_000070_000000.wav|"Cancer in the stomach!
3752_4944_000100_000000.wav|Twice he paused on the way to the sitting room, and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will.
3752_4944_000060_000000.wav|"Well, he'll be put into the hospital for a week or so to morrow," said Macklewain, "and that'll give him a spell."
3752_4944_000066_000000.wav|"Pray, don't hurry," said Meekin politely.
3752_4944_000070_000004.wav|This seems a very pleasant place, and I think I shall enjoy myself very much.
7976_110523_000005_000000.wav|HANSEL AND GRETHEL
7976_110523_000006_000001.wav|He had little enough to break or bite; and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could hardly procure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed one night, he sighed, and said to his wife, "What will become of us? How can we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat ourselves?"
7976_110523_000024_000003.wav|Soon they were so tired that they could not drag themselves along, then they lay down under a tree and again went to sleep.
7976_110523_000036_000002.wav|This the good little bird did, and when both were happily arrived on the other side, and had gone a little way, they came to a well-known wood, which they knew the better every step they went, and at last they perceived their father's house.
7976_110523_000012_000000.wav|The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the two children.
7976_110523_000027_000012.wav|So a nice meal was cooked for Hansel, but Grethel got nothing else but a crab's claw.
7976_110523_000016_000005.wav|They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, "You wicked children!
7976_110523_000013_000000.wav|"Ah, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house, and trying to say good bye."
7976_110523_000027_000010.wav|Witches have red eyes, and cannot see very far; but they have a fine sense of smelling, like wild beasts, so that they know when children approach them.
7976_110523_000036_000003.wav|Then they began to run, and rushing into the house, they fell upon their father's neck.
7976_110523_000029_000001.wav|"First, we will bake, however," said the old woman; "I have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough;" and so saying, she pushed poor Grethel up to the oven, out of which the flames were burning fiercely.
7976_110523_000024_000000.wav|When noon came, Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn his on the path.
7976_110523_000022_000002.wav|"Hansel, why do you stop and look about?" said the father, "keep in the path." "I am looking at my little dove," answered Hansel, "nodding a good bye to me." "Simpleton!" said the wife, "that is no dove, but only the sun shining on the chimney." But Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along.
7976_110523_000016_000007.wav|We thought you were never coming home again." But their father was extremely glad, for it had grieved his heart to leave them all alone.
7976_110523_000008_000000.wav|"No, wife," replied he, "that I can never do; how can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood; for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces?"
7976_110523_000022_000001.wav|On the way Hansel broke his in his pocket, and stopping every now and then, dropped a crumb upon the path.
7976_110523_000032_000000.wav|So he sprang out, like a bird from his cage when the door was opened; and they were so glad that they fell upon each other's neck, and kissed each other over and over again.
7976_110523_000027_000002.wav|Will they not be sweet?" So Hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof, in order to see how it tasted; while Grethel stepped up to the window and began to bite it.
7976_110523_000029_000004.wav|See, I could even get in myself!" and she got up, and put her head into the oven.
7976_110523_000019_000000.wav|But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, "It were better to share the last crust with the children." His wife, however, would listen to nothing that he said, and scolded and reproached him without end.
7976_110523_000016_000004.wav|All night long they walked on, and as day broke they came to their father's house.
7976_110523_000024_000002.wav|Hansel kept saying to Grethel, "We will soon find the way;" but they did not, and they walked the whole night long and the next day, but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon the bushes.
7976_110523_000028_000002.wav|"Dear good God, help us now!" she prayed.
7976_110523_000027_000004.wav|Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so he tore off a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round pane out of the window, and sat down quite contentedly.
7976_110523_000006_000000.wav|Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood cutter, with his wife, and two children by his former marriage, a little boy called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel.
7976_110523_000029_000000.wav|So early in the morning Grethel was compelled to go out and fill the kettle, and make a fire.
7976_110523_000035_000000.wav|"Little Duck, good little Duck, Grethel and Hansel, together we stand; There is neither stile nor bridge, Take us on your back to land."

7976_110523_000027_000006.wav|Hansel and Grethel were so much frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands; but the old woman nodding her head, said, "Ah, you dear children, what has brought you here?

7976_110523_000010_000001.wav|Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, "What will become of us?"
7976_110523_000026_000001.wav|As soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful, snow white bird sitting upon a bough, singing so sweetly that they stood still and listened to it.
7976_110523_000027_000007.wav|Come in and stop with me, and no harm shall come to you;" and so saying she took them both by the hand, and led them into her cottage.
7976_110523_000026_000000.wav|It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house, and they still walked on; but they only got deeper, and deeper, and deeper into the wood, and Hansel felt that if help did not come very soon they must die of hunger.
7976_110523_000032_000001.wav|And now, as there was nothing to fear, they went back to the witch's house, where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones.
7976_110523_000028_000000.wav|Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said, "Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel whether you are getting fat." But Hansel used to stretch out a bone, and the old woman, having very bad sight, thought it was his finger, and wondered very much why he did not get fat.
7976_110523_000029_000005.wav|Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she fell right in, and shutting the iron door bolted it.
7976_110523_000016_000000.wav|Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon, each ate the piece of bread; and because they could hear the blows of an axe they thought their father was near; but it was not an axe, but a branch which he had bound to an old tree, so as to be blown to and fro by the wind.
7976_110523_000034_000000.wav|"We cannot get over," said Hansel; "I can see no bridge at all." "And there is no boat either," said Grethel, "but there swims a white duck, I will ask her to help us over;" and she sang,
7976_110523_000016_000002.wav|When they awoke, it was quite dark, and Grethel began to cry.
7976_110523_000027_000008.wav|A good meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples and nuts, was spread on the table, and in the back room were two nice little beds, covered with white, where Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down, and were happy as could be.
7976_110523_000031_000000.wav|Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening the door, called out, "Hansel we are saved; the old witch is dead?"
7976_110523_000028_000003.wav|"Had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood, then we should have died together." But the old witch called out, "Leave off that noise; it will not help you a bit."
7976_110523_000032_000002.wav|"These are better than pebbles," said Hansel, putting as many into his pocket as it would hold; while Grethel thought, "I will take some home too," and filled her apron full.
7976_110523_000036_000000.wav|So the Duck came to them, and Hansel sat himself on, and bade his sister sit beside him.
7976_110523_000022_000000.wav|Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed, and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than the former piece.
7976_110523_000011_000000.wav|"Be quiet, Grethel," said he; "do not cry-I will help you." And as soon as their parents had gone to sleep, he got up, put on his coat, and, unbarring the back door, went out.

7976_110523_000014_000000.wav|"You simpleton!" said the wife, "that is not a cat; it is only the sun shining on the white chimney." But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time he stopped, he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path.
7976_110523_000033_000000.wav|"We must be off now," said Hansel, "and get out of this enchanted forest;" but when they had walked for two hours they came to a large piece of water.
7976_110523_000012_000002.wav|When they had gone a little distance, Hansel stood still, and peeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till his father said, "Hansel, what are you looking at, and why do you lag behind?
7976_110523_000015_000002.wav|Then they set fire to them; and as the flame burnt up high, the wife said, "Now, you children, lie down near the fire, and rest yourselves, whilst we go into the forest and chop more wood; when we are ready we will come and call you."
7976_110523_000029_000006.wav|Oh! how horribly the witch howled; but Grethel ran away, and left her to burn to ashes.
7976_110523_000036_000001.wav|"No," replied Grethel, "that will be too much for the Duck, she shall take us over one at a time."
7976_110523_000023_000001.wav|We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening, when we are ready, we will come and fetch you again."
7976_110523_000021_000000.wav|The children, however, had heard the conversation as they lay awake, and as soon as their parents went to sleep Hansel got up, intending to pick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, so that he could not get out.
7976_110523_000027_000000.wav|"We will go in here," said Hansel, "and have a glorious feast.
7976_110523_000009_000000.wav|"Oh, you simpleton!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger; you had better plane the coffins for us." But she left him no peace till he consented, saying, "Ah, but I shall miss the poor children."
7976_110523_000027_000001.wav|I will eat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the window.
7976_110523_000016_000006.wav|Why did you sleep so long in the wood?
7976_110523_000027_000005.wav|Just then the door opened, and a very old woman, walking upon crutches, came out.
7976_110523_000021_000001.wav|Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying, "Do not weep; sleep in quiet; the good God will not forsake us."
7976_105575_000011_000012.wav|Yet it looked very bad for us.

7976_110124_000053_000003.wav|At last it was daylight and the band of thieves had to flee.
7976_110124_000036_000002.wav|The little girl flew down the stairs and closed the doors of the store securely.
7976_110124_000012_000000.wav|"Be sure that you admit no one," commanded the merchant.
7976_110124_000005_000001.wav|Every year at a certain day of a certain month he went away to a distant city to collect money on an account.
7976_110124_000053_000000.wav|The cries and curses of the robbers filled the air.
7976_110124_000014_000001.wav|The captain of the band had watched the merchant's departure, and when he was safely away the thief dressed himself in the disguise of an old beggar. When it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchant's house.
7976_110124_000019_000002.wav|We can give this poor beggar some alms and send him away with a blessing."
7976_110124_000032_000001.wav|The beggar entered the room.
7976_110124_000054_000000.wav|In the morning the effect of the sleeping powder wore off and the two elder sisters awoke.
7976_110124_000017_000000.wav|The second daughter peeped out of the window at the beggar.
7976_110124_000006_000000.wav|"I cannot bear to go away," he said to them.
7976_110124_000032_000007.wav|It hurt terribly when he stuck the pin into the foot of the youngest, but she did not stir.
7976_110124_000007_000000.wav|He worried about the matter night and day.
7976_110124_000019_000000.wav|"Remember our promise to our father!" cried the youngest one.
7976_110124_000059_000000.wav|"Oh, why didn't we keep our promise to our father!" cried the middle one.
7976_110124_000043_000000.wav|The leader of the band of thieves went up close to the keyhole and whispered: "Kind lady of the house, have pity on me."
7976_110124_000061_000000.wav|"I see that no harm befell you in my absence," he said as he embraced them fondly.
7976_110124_000031_000000.wav|As soon as they had eaten, the girls went to their room, and the two eldest were overcome with sleep almost before they had time to get into bed.
7976_110124_000062_000001.wav|"Great danger threatened us while you were away," she said.
7976_110124_000033_000001.wav|She saw to her surprise that he had laid aside the heavy ragged old coat which he had kept wrapped about him even while he ate. Underneath he was dressed like a robber with a sword, pistols and dagger.
7976_110124_000021_000000.wav|The second daughter added.
7976_110124_000064_000000.wav|When the merchant had heard the whole story, he said: "After this we must all give ear to the wisdom of this little maid.
7976_110124_000032_000002.wav|The youngest one pretended that she, too, was asleep.
7976_110124_000011_000000.wav|"We can lock ourselves securely in the house and not let any one enter," said the three daughters.
7976_110124_000032_000005.wav|Then he went to the bed of the second sister and did the same.
7976_110124_000008_000000.wav|However, the question of leaving three such pretty girls unprotected was a thing not to be regarded lightly.
7976_110124_000021_000002.wav|If we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it."
7976_110124_000010_000001.wav|"I am older and wiser than you are and I know that there are many evils which might come upon you. There are many bold thieves in this city, for instance, who would be only too ready to take advantage of my absence and rob my home of all I possess."
7976_110124_000063_000000.wav|"Our little sister was wiser than we were," said the middle daughter.
7976_110124_000030_000000.wav|While they were talking, the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them.
7976_110124_000038_000000.wav|"He'll find it difficult to get into our house again," she said to herself as she waited to see if the robber returned.
7976_110124_000048_000000.wav|"It's in the fire," replied the girl.
7976_110124_000033_000000.wav|The youngest sister peeped through her long heavy eyelashes and watched the beggar.
7976_110124_000041_000001.wav|I was suspicious of her from the first."
7976_110124_000062_000000.wav|The eldest daughter blushed and hung her head.
7976_110124_000014_000002.wav|He knocked at the door.
7976_110124_000005_000003.wav|That year the merchant looked forward to his journey with dread for he would have to leave his daughters alone.
7976_110124_000030_000002.wav|She threw the apple away.
7976_110124_000023_000000.wav|However, in spite of all she could say, the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar.
7976_110124_000053_000002.wav|The doors were strong and held securely.
7976_110124_000052_000000.wav|She quickly ran upstairs and got the robber's sword which he had left on a chair in the dining room.
7976_110124_000031_000001.wav|The youngest one was so frightened that she could not sleep a single wink.
7976_110124_000015_000000.wav|"Have pity upon a poor unfortunate one!" he called out.
7976_110124_000032_000003.wav|The man went to the bed of the eldest sister and stuck a pin into her foot to see if she were completely unconscious.
7976_110124_000010_000000.wav|"How do you know?" asked their father.
7976_110124_000034_000001.wav|Then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store.
7976_110124_000033_000002.wav|She was so terribly frightened that it was all she could do to keep her teeth from chattering.
7976_110124_000030_000001.wav|The two eldest ate their apples, but the youngest could not eat that night.
7976_110124_000056_000001.wav|"I had such a nightmare myself that I have a headache this morning."
7976_110124_000015_000002.wav|Let me enter, I pray you, to pass the night under your roof."
7976_110124_000049_000001.wav|"Then you can pull my charm out in safety."
7976_110124_000036_000003.wav|They were big and heavy, but her great fear gave her strength.
7976_110124_000006_000001.wav|"My heart is filled with fear lest some evil may befall you during my absence."
7976_110124_000046_000001.wav|"You shall not come into my father's house."
7976_110124_000057_000000.wav|It was not until their little sister had shown them the robber's hand and the great sword that they were convinced that she had told them the truth.
7976_110124_000014_000000.wav|Now, outside this city there was a band of bold robbers.
7976_110124_000009_000000.wav|"Do not be afraid to leave us, dear father," said his daughters. "Nothing will harm us while you are away."
7976_110124_000053_000001.wav|They tried in vain to break down the great doors.
7976_110124_000013_000000.wav|They gave him their promise and he started on his journey. Nevertheless, he went with an anxious heart.
7976_110124_000020_000001.wav|"It is not for the youngest and most childish one of us to make the plans," she said.
7976_110124_000061_000001.wav|"All my worries about you were foolish."
7976_110124_000049_000000.wav|"Go throw vinegar on the fire and put it out," said the captain of the thieves.
7976_110124_000027_000000.wav|"For shame!" cried the eldest.
7976_110124_000044_000000.wav|The merchant's daughter at first did not answer; but, as he kept on calling to her, she finally asked him what it was that he wanted.
7976_110124_000018_000001.wav|"Our father has always taught us to show mercy and kindness to the aged."
7976_110124_000041_000000.wav|"It was the youngest one who deceived me!" cried the robber chieftain. "I knew all the time that she did not want to let me in.
7976_110124_000051_000000.wav|"Put your hand through the hole in the door," replied the little maid. "Then I'll give you your charm."
7976_110124_000032_000000.wav|Soon she heard footsteps.
7976_110124_000021_000001.wav|"We two are older and wiser than you are. It is for us to determine what shall be done.
7976_110124_000026_000000.wav|"I am thinking that our dear father would be anxious if he knew that we had broken our promise so easily," said the youngest sister.
7976_110124_000045_000000.wav|"I have left my charm behind!" he cried.
7976_110124_000050_000000.wav|Now it happened that there was a little hole in the door just large enough for a man's hand to enter.
7976_110124_000016_000000.wav|"It's surely a terrible storm outside," said the merchant's eldest daughter, as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows.
7976_110124_000023_000003.wav|They gave him his supper in the kitchen and then they ate their own.
7976_110124_000060_000000.wav|When at last the merchant returned from the distant city where he had been to collect money he was delighted to find his house and his three daughters safe.
7976_110124_000042_000001.wav|"She may not be so wise as she appears.
7976_110124_000032_000008.wav|The robber thought that she was as completely overcome by the sleeping powder as the others.
7976_110124_000024_000000.wav|"It is a fearful night to send away a beggar," said the eldest sister while they were eating.
7976_110124_000055_000001.wav|"You are making it up."
7976_110124_000005_000002.wav|His wife and daughters remained at home, and all went well until one sad day the wife died.
7976_110124_000032_000004.wav|She did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work.
7976_110124_000045_000001.wav|"Pray let me enter to get it. I promise you I will do you no harm."
7976_110124_000062_000002.wav|"Thanks to our youngest sister, we are safe."
3081_166546_000070_000000.wav|"So they tell me."
3081_166546_000101_000001.wav|The weapon must still have been there.
3081_166546_000028_000002.wav|How quickly he disappeared!"
3081_166546_000071_000005.wav|What do you make of it, Gryce?"
3081_166546_000049_000005.wav|Perhaps you can.
3081_166546_000097_000000.wav|"But the blood?

3576_138058_000042_000000.wav|"Well then, away with you all," said Roque, "and bring them here to me at once without letting one of them escape."
3576_138058_000051_000000.wav|One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, "This captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants to be so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not ours."

3576_138058_000033_000000.wav|"What are you talking about, man?" said one of the bystanders; "I have got them, and they are not worth three reals."
3576_138058_000019_000003.wav|He wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up to him he said, "Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart's, which are more merciful than cruel."
3576_138058_000024_000001.wav|Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; I will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty."

3576_138058_000039_000000.wav|At this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief, came up and said, "Senor, there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to Barcelona."
3576_138058_000037_000000.wav|Upon this Sancho remarked, "From what I have seen here, justice is such a good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thieves themselves."
3576_138058_000013_000000.wav|"It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;" and at the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.
3576_138058_000018_000002.wav|Don Quixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of.
3576_138058_000018_000001.wav|He trembled with fear and made for another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him.

6319_275224_000011_000004.wav|Really, with your natural grace and beauty, I think you might be trusted to yourself a little more!"
6319_275224_000009_000000.wav|Now the Convolvulus was quite abashed by the words of the Wind, for she was conscious of feeling very conceited that morning, in consequence of having heard the gardener say something very flattering about her beauty; so she hung down her rich bell flowers rather lower than usual, and made no reply.
6319_275224_000024_000002.wav|Presently, with sorrowing steps, she bent her way round the flower beds, weeping afresh at every one she looked at; and then she sat down upon the lawn, and hid her face in her hands. In this position she remained, until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder.
6319_275224_000008_000007.wav|I quite feel for you!
6319_275224_000022_000009.wav|The Honeysuckle escaped no better; and the Carnation was ready to die of vexation, at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt.
6319_275224_000026_000000.wav|"I am not thinking about the garden, mamma," replied the young girl, without lifting up her face; "we can plant new flowers, and tie up even some of these afresh.

6319_275224_000018_000000.wav|Then the white Lily called out to him in great wrath, and told him he mistook their characters altogether.
6319_275224_000022_000003.wav|The white Lily still stood somewhat upright, though no friendly pole supported her juicy stem; but, alas! it was only by a painful effort she could hold herself in that position.
6319_275224_000015_000000.wav|And so she did, and a new light seemed to dawn upon her as she recollected the spring and autumnal prunings she regularly underwent, and the quantities of little branches that were yearly cut from her sides, and carried away in a wheel barrow.

6319_275224_000021_000001.wav|Making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden, he knocked over the Convolvulus pole, tore the strips from the stick that held up the white Lily, loosed all the Carnation flowers from their fastenings, broke the Rose Tree down, and levelled the Sweet Peas to the ground.
6319_275224_000016_000002.wav|Did that lovely creature suppose that Nature, who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world, had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure?

6319_275224_000019_000000.wav|To which the wicked Wind, seeing that his temptations had succeeded, replied, in great glee, that he would do his best; and so he went away, chuckling at the discontent he had caused.

6319_275224_000012_000000.wav|And the Carnation began to think so, too; and her colour turned deeper as a feeling of indignation arose within her at the childish treatment to which she had been subjected.
6319_275224_000017_000003.wav|He murmured among them all-laughed the trim cut Box edges to scorn-maliciously hoped the Sweet Peas enjoyed growing in a circle, and running up a quantity of crooked sticks-and told the flowers, generally, that he should report their unheard of submission and meek obedience wherever he went.
6319_275224_000011_000003.wav|Why must every single flower betied up by its delicate neck to a stick, the moment it begins to open?
6319_275224_000016_000000.wav|Then the Wind took another frolic round the garden, and made up to the large white Lily, into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid, ugly stick!

6319_275224_000008_000000.wav|"I smile at your question," was the answer of the Wind.
6319_275224_000023_000005.wav|Alas! what he said was true; and before many days had passed, the shattered Carnations were rotted with lying in the wet and dirt on the ground.

6319_64726_000017_000002.wav|Then the prince took the princess by the hand; she was dressed in great splendour, but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look; he thought her all the more charming for that.

6319_64726_000012_000002.wav|That was needless, for in a quarter of an hour there had grown up about it a wood so thick and filled with thorns that nothing could get at the castle, and the castle top itself could only be seen from a great distance.

2035_147961_000011_000000.wav|Presently Pavel began to talk to mr Shimerda, scarcely above a whisper. He was telling a long story, and as he went on, Antonia took my hand under the table and held it tight.
2035_147961_000005_000006.wav|We lay still and did not talk.
2035_147961_000030_000004.wav|Pavel tried to drag her away. In the struggle, the groom rose.
2035_147961_000006_000001.wav|The ruddy windows guided us-the light from the kitchen stove, for there was no lamp burning.
2035_147961_000014_000004.wav|We sat and watched the long bowed back under the blue sheet, scarcely daring to breathe.
2035_147961_000033_000000.wav|At his sale we bought Peter's wheelbarrow and some of his harness.
2035_147961_000020_000005.wav|The road was clear and white, and the groom's three blacks went like the wind.
2035_147961_000025_000004.wav|They tried to jump over each other, got tangled up in the harness, and overturned the sledge.
2035_147961_000007_000006.wav|The wind shook the doors and windows impatiently, then swept on again, singing through the big spaces.
2035_147961_000009_000001.wav|His shirt was hanging open, and his emaciated chest, covered with yellow bristle, rose and fell horribly.
2035_147961_000019_000004.wav|The groom had the best team and his sledge was lightest-all the others carried from six to a dozen people.
2035_147961_000024_000006.wav|The black ground shadows were already crowding over the heap in the road, and one horse ran out across the fields, his harness hanging to him, wolves at his heels.

2035_147961_000018_000005.wav|The wolves ran like streaks of shadow; they looked no bigger than dogs, but there were hundreds of them.

2035_147961_000030_000003.wav|The young man cursed him and held her tighter.
2035_147961_000007_000000.wav|We entered softly.
2035_147961_000002_000004.wav|He only knew that he had first borrowed two hundred dollars, then another hundred, then fifty-that each time a bonus was added to the principal, and the debt grew faster than any crop he planted.
2035_147961_000003_000002.wav|The Russians had such bad luck that people were afraid of them and liked to put them out of mind.
2035_147961_000030_000002.wav|He called to the groom that they must lighten-and pointed to the bride.
2035_147961_000017_000001.wav|The dinner lasted all afternoon; then it became a supper and continued far into the night.
2035_147961_000004_000000.wav|One afternoon Antonia and her father came over to our house to get buttermilk, and lingered, as they usually did, until the sun was low.

2035_147961_000024_000000.wav|Pavel reached the brow of the hill, but only two sledges followed him down the other side.

2035_147961_000002_000000.wav|WHILE the autumn color was growing pale on the grass and cornfields, things went badly with our friends the Russians.
2035_147961_000007_000014.wav|Pavel called for something and struggled up on his elbow.
2035_147961_000031_000003.wav|They went away to strange towns, but when people learned where they came from, they were always asked if they knew the two men who had fed the bride to the wolves.

2035_147961_000029_000000.wav|"Twenty, thirty-enough."
2035_147961_000002_000001.wav|peter told his troubles to mr Shimerda: he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of November; had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it, and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow.
2035_147961_000011_000002.wav|He grew more and more excited, and kept pointing all around his bed, as if there were things there and he wanted mr Shimerda to see them.
2035_147961_000024_000007.wav|But the groom's movement had given Pavel an idea.
2035_147961_000015_000001.wav|What she did not tell me then, she told later; we talked of nothing else for days afterward.
2035_147961_000012_000001.wav|"It's awful, what he says!"

2035_147961_000003_000001.wav|Misfortune seemed to settle like an evil bird on the roof of the log house, and to flap its wings there, warning human beings away.

2035_147960_000005_000006.wav|When I turned he was lying in long loose waves, like a letter "W." He twitched and began to coil slowly.
2035_147960_000011_000003.wav|As I turned him over I began to feel proud of him, to have a kind of respect for his age and size.
2035_147960_000003_000004.wav|We might get some puppies, or owl eggs, or snake skins.
2035_147960_000009_000002.wav|A faint, fetid smell came from him, and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head.
2035_147960_000013_000003.wav|Antonia called him to come quick and look.
2035_147960_000017_000000.wav|"We'd been up to Russian Peter's, to borrow a spade for Ambrosch."
2035_147960_000019_000001.wav|He is all over Jimmy's boots. I scream for him to run, but he just hit and hit that snake like he was crazy."
2035_147960_000005_000014.wav|I struck now from hate.
2035_147960_000004_000006.wav|As we approached, they barked, shook their tails at us, and scurried underground.
2035_147960_000011_000004.wav|He seemed like the ancient, eldest Evil. Certainly his kind have left horrible unconscious memories in all warm blooded life.
2035_147960_000003_000002.wav|As we rode away with the spade, Antonia suggested that we stop at the prairie dog town and dig into one of the holes.
2035_147960_000013_000001.wav|Otto Fuchs was the first one we met.
2035_147960_000023_000003.wav|I had killed a big snake-I was now a big fellow.

2035_147960_000002_000001.wav|I offered to take her on the pony, and she got up behind me.
2035_147960_000005_000019.wav|Antonia came after me, crying, "O Jimmy, he not bite you?
2035_147960_000010_000000.wav|"Look, Tony, that's his poison," I said.
2035_147960_000004_000005.wav|The dogs were out, as usual, dozens of them, sitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses.
2035_147960_000012_000000.wav|We decided that Antonia should ride Dude home, and I would walk.
2035_147960_000002_000003.wav|Within a week all the blooming roads had been despoiled-hundreds of miles of yellow sunflowers had been transformed into brown, rattling, burry stalks.
2035_147960_000018_000001.wav|"It was just luck you had a tool," he said cautiously.
2035_147960_000015_000000.wav|"Up at the dog town," I answered laconically.
2035_147960_000005_000012.wav|I saw his coils tighten-now he would spring, spring his length, I remembered.

2035_147960_000005_000009.wav|He was as thick as my leg, and looked as if millstones could n't crush the disgusting vitality out of him.
2035_147960_000004_000009.wav|It was on one of these gravel beds that I met my adventure.
2035_147960_000005_000002.wav|I was walking backward, in a crouching position, when I heard Antonia scream.
2035_147960_000005_000015.wav|Antonia, barefooted as she was, ran up behind me.
2035_147960_000008_000003.wav|Now we take that snake home and show everybody.
2035_147960_000022_000005.wav|I had been adequately armed by Russian peter; the snake was old and lazy; and I had Antonia beside me, to appreciate and admire.
2035_147960_000005_000017.wav|I walked away and turned my back.
2035_147960_000006_000001.wav|You might have told me there was a snake behind me!" I said petulantly.
2035_147960_000004_000002.wav|The holes were several yards apart, and were disposed with a good deal of regularity, almost as if the town had been laid out in streets and avenues.
2035_147960_000009_000000.wav|She went on in this strain until I began to think that I had longed for this opportunity, and had hailed it with joy.
2035_147960_000005_000013.wav|I ran up and drove at his head with my spade, struck him fairly across the neck, and in a minute he was all about my feet in wavy loops.
2035_147960_000005_000016.wav|Even after I had pounded his ugly head flat, his body kept on coiling and winding, doubling and falling back on itself.
2035_147960_000005_000011.wav|I did n't run because I did n't think of it-if my back had been against a stone wall I could n't have felt more cornered.
2035_147960_000005_000018.wav|I felt seasick.
2035_147960_000011_000002.wav|I explained to Antonia how this meant that he was twenty four years old, that he must have been there when white men first came, left on from buffalo and Indian times.
2035_147960_000022_000000.wav|Subsequent experiences with rattlesnakes taught me that my first encounter was fortunate in circumstance.
2035_147960_000013_000004.wav|He did not say anything for a minute, but scratched his head and turned the snake over with his boot.
2035_147960_000018_000006.wav|Did he fight hard?"
2035_147960_000009_000001.wav|Cautiously we went back to the snake; he was still groping with his tail, turning up his ugly belly in the light.
2035_147960_000004_000007.wav|Before the mouths of the holes were little patches of sand and gravel, scratched up, we supposed, from a long way below the surface.
2035_147960_000023_000002.wav|She liked me better from that time on, and she never took a supercilious air with me again.
2035_147960_000011_000005.wav|When we dragged him down into the draw, Dude sprang off to the end of his tether and shivered all over-would n't let us come near him.
2035_147960_000001_000001.wav|She was four years older than I, to be sure, and had seen more of the world; but I was a boy and she was a girl, and I resented her protecting manner.
2035_147960_000004_000000.wav|The dog town was spread out over perhaps ten acres.
2035_147960_000020_000000.wav|Otto winked at me.
2035_147960_000023_000001.wav|This was enough for Antonia.
2035_147960_000012_000002.wav|I followed with the spade over my shoulder, dragging my snake.
2035_147960_000023_000000.wav|That snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the neighbors came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts.
2035_147960_000012_000003.wav|Her exultation was contagious.
2035_147960_000012_000005.wav|If the red grass were full of rattlers, I was equal to them all. Nevertheless, I stole furtive glances behind me now and then to see that no avenging mate, older and bigger than my quarry, was racing up from the rear.
2035_147960_000007_000001.wav|I suppose I looked as sick as I felt.
3853_163249_000061_000000.wav|Letty smiled at him approvingly, then went to comfort her mother who could not recover her tranquillity so soon.
3853_163249_000123_000000.wav|Then they stood quite still for a time, and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter. Presently David said regretfully:
3853_163249_000050_000000.wav|"You've something to tell me: I see it in your face."
3853_163249_000143_000000.wav|"Only this," and she touched the flowers, adding with her hand on the blue coat sleeve that embraced her: "I want to consecrate my uniform as you do yours by being married in it.
3853_163249_000054_000000.wav|"I go too."
3853_163249_000161_000000.wav|Christie was going to town to see the regiment off, and soon followed with mr Power.
3853_163249_000088_000000.wav|Imagine her dismay, when, having consumed the bait, her fish gave signs of breaking the line, and escaping after all; for mr Wilkins pushed back his chair, and said slowly, as he filled his pipe:
3853_163249_000127_000000.wav|"I'll try," was all his answer to her appeal; then proved that he meant it by adding, with his lips against her cheek: "I must go to mother and Letty.
3853_163249_000062_000000.wav|"O David, you are splendid!
3853_163249_000056_000000.wav|That was all: she did not offer to detain him now; he did not deny her right to follow.
3853_163249_000067_000001.wav|Finding that Lisha showed little enthusiasm on the subject, she tried to rouse him by patriotic appeals of various sorts.
3853_163249_000130_000000.wav|"David sends you these, dear.
3853_163249_000138_000001.wav|Power has come," she said softly a few minutes later, with an anxious glance at the clock.
3853_163249_000120_000000.wav|"Nothing can part us any more, not even death; for love like ours will last for ever."
3853_163249_000107_000000.wav|"Another great battle!" screamed the excited news boys in the streets.
3853_163249_000060_000000.wav|When mr Power presently came in, followed by the others, they found their soldier standing very erect in his old place on the rug, with the firelight gleaming on his bright buttons, and Bran staring at him with a perplexed aspect; for the uniform, shorn hair, trimmed beard, and a certain lofty carriage of the head so changed his master that the sagacious beast was disturbed.
3853_163249_000035_000000.wav|"You mean it?"
3853_163249_000112_000000.wav|"We are ordered off at once, and go at four this afternoon.
3853_163249_000070_000000.wav|Which threat she carried out with such skill and force that Lisha was effectually waked up, for he was "partial to good vittles," and Cynthy was a capital cook.
3853_163249_000112_000002.wav|Now, let's be brave and enjoy every minute of it."
3853_163249_000169_000000.wav|Even the lookers on were different.
3853_163249_000125_000003.wav|Surely I shall if I give you and myself to the cause; and I do it gladly, though I know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet, when my courage fails, as it will by and by, and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over.
3853_163249_000115_000000.wav|"What promise?"
3853_163249_000036_000002.wav|I, too, have prepared for it, and even spoken to mrs Amory.
3853_163249_000124_000002.wav|Now it's all so hurried, sorrowful, and strange.
3853_163249_000051_000000.wav|"Dear, I must go."
3853_163249_000139_000000.wav|"Go dear, I'll come directly.
3853_163249_000135_000001.wav|But I think few brides dress with a braver, happier heart than mine, though I do choose a sober wedding gown," answered Christie, smiling again, as she took from a half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft, gray, woollen stuff.
3853_163249_000065_000000.wav|David meantime was in camp, getting his first taste of martial life, and not liking it any better than he thought he should; but no one heard a complaint, and he never regretted his "love among the roses," for he was one of the men who had a "principle as well as a weapon," and meant to do good service with both.
3853_163249_000145_000000.wav|"Then I'm satisfied."
3853_163249_000066_000001.wav|He accepted all that came, and furnished forth those of his company who were less favored. Among these was Elisha Wilkins, and how he got there should be told.
3853_163249_000166_000000.wav|Wash had heard drums every five minutes since he arrived, but this time he was right, and began to cheer the instant a red cockade appeared at the other end of the long street.
3853_163249_000075_000001.wav|Nature abhors a vacuum, and when food fell short patriotism had a chance to fill the aching void.
3853_163249_000049_000000.wav|She put her arm in his, and answered quickly:
3853_163249_000169_000001.wav|Once all was wild enthusiasm and glad uproar; now men's lips were set, and women's smileless even as they cheered; fewer handkerchiefs whitened the air, for wet eyes needed them; and sudden lulls, almost solemn in their stillness, followed the acclamations of the crowd.
3853_163249_000052_000000.wav|"Yes, David."
3853_163249_000146_000001.wav|Power is waiting: are you ready, love?"
3853_163249_000116_000000.wav|"This;" and he held out his hand with a little paper in it.
3853_163249_000101_000000.wav|Before mrs Wilkins could reply to these conflicting rumors her husband walked in, looking as martial as his hollow chest and thin legs permitted, and, turning his cap nervously in his hands, said half proudly, half reproachfully:
3853_163249_000043_000002.wav|She never had yet, and now resolved to ask nothing, but to earn her blessing by doing her share in the great work.
3853_163249_000140_000000.wav|"I'm glad to give him to you, Christie; for now I feel as if I had partly paid the great debt I've owed so long," answered Letty through her tears.
3853_163249_000070_000001.wav|Poor rations did not suit him, and he demanded why his favorite dishes were not forthcoming.
3853_163249_000048_000000.wav|"Come and walk a little in the lane."
3853_163249_000152_000000.wav|"THEN THEY WERE MARRIED."
3853_163249_000126_000000.wav|Christie was lifted out of herself for the moment, and looked inspired by the high mood which was but the beginning of a nobler life for her.
3853_163249_000109_000000.wav|"My precious people, I've got something to tell you: are you ready?"
3853_163249_000055_000000.wav|"Yes, Christie."
3853_163249_000114_000000.wav|"Keep your promise, dear," he answered, while the warlike expression changed to one of infinite tenderness.
3853_163249_000091_000000.wav|"Lisha, ain't you got no heart?
3853_163249_000160_000000.wav|At the turn of the lane, he looked back and swung his cap; all waved their hands to him; and then he marched away to the great work before him, leaving those loving hearts to ask the unanswerable question: "How will he come home?"
3853_163249_000098_000000.wav|"He's a comin', Ma!" called Gusty, presently.
3853_163249_000105_000000.wav|"I'm glad I done it; for it will make a man of Lisha; and, if I've sent him to his death, God knows he'll be fitter to die than if he stayed here idlin' his life away."
3853_163249_000134_000000.wav|"My dearest Christie, don't be superstitious: all brides wear roses, and Davy thought you'd like them," said Letty, troubled at her words.
3853_163249_000157_000000.wav|"I must go!" cried David with a sort of desperation, as Letty clung to one arm, Christie to the other.
3853_163249_000095_000000.wav|"I thought that would fetch him!"
3853_163249_000033_000000.wav|"Good!
3853_163249_000128_000000.wav|He went, and Christie vanished to make ready for her wedding, conscious, in spite of her exalted state of mind, that every thing was very hurried, sad, and strange, and very different from the happy day she had so often planned.
3853_163249_000091_000003.wav|Lisha Wilkins, look at that, and say no e f you darst!"
3853_163249_000079_000000.wav|"Of course he has! any man with the spirit of a muskeeter would."
3853_163249_000102_000000.wav|"Now, Cynthy, be you satisfied?"
3853_163249_000171_000000.wav|"I could not love thee, dear, so much, Loved I not honor more."
3853_163249_000153_000000.wav|David and Christie went smiling away together, and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers, and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts.
3853_163249_000044_000000.wav|"I shall remember that," was all David answered to that last promise of hers, and three months later he took her at her word.
3853_163249_000121_000000.wav|"Then you are quite willing to try the third great experiment?"
3853_163249_000125_000001.wav|I've always wanted to live in stirring times, to have a part in great deeds, to sacrifice and suffer something for a principle or a person; and now I have my wish.
3853_163249_000111_000000.wav|"Ready, my General."
3853_163249_000125_000004.wav|Help me to be brave and strong, David: don't let me complain or regret, but show me what lies beyond, and teach me to believe that simply doing the right is reward and happiness enough."
3853_163249_000170_000000.wav|As the inspiring music, the grand tramp drew near, Christie felt the old thrill and longed to fall in and follow the flag anywhere.
3853_163249_000062_000003.wav|Here he is, my knight without reproach or fear, going out to take his part in the grandest battle ever fought.
3853_163249_000062_000002.wav|Yes, mr Power, I've found my hero at last!
3853_163249_000077_000000.wav|"David Sterlin' has enlisted!"
3853_163249_000137_000000.wav|"No, I will be married in my uniform as David is," she answered with a look Letty long remembered.
3853_163249_000068_000000.wav|But nothing seemed to rouse the supine Elisha, who chewed his quid like a placid beast of the field, and showed no sign of a proper spirit.
3853_163249_000110_000001.wav|mrs Sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head.
3853_163249_000127_000001.wav|We leave them behind, and they must be comforted."
3853_163249_000142_000000.wav|"No bridal white, dear?" said David, going to her.
3853_163249_000119_000000.wav|She understood, put both arms about his neck as if to keep him safe, and whispered fervently:
3853_163249_000155_000000.wav|A very simple little marriage feast, but more love, good will, and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts; and better than any speech or song was Letty's broken whisper, as she folded her arms round David's empty chair when no one saw her, "Heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us."
3853_163249_000074_000000.wav|He said no more but fell a thinking.
3853_163249_000125_000000.wav|"Have no fear for me: I feel as if I could bear any thing just now; for I've got into a heroic mood and I mean to keep so as long as I can.
3853_163249_000147_000000.wav|"Quite ready."
3853_163249_000032_000000.wav|"Yes, David," sister and sweetheart answered, bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences God might see fit to send.
3853_163249_000024_000000.wav|"How terrible!
3853_163249_000159_000000.wav|"Give the last kiss to mother," added Letty, following her example, and in another minute David was gone.
3853_163249_000076_000002.wav|This was a favorite dish of Lisha's, and she had prepared it as a bait for this cautious fish. To say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bait, hook and all, but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering man.
3853_163249_000131_000000.wav|"I thought he'd give me violets," and a shadow came over Christie's face.
3853_163249_000064_000001.wav|mrs Sterling cut up her treasured old linen without a murmur; Letty made "comfort bags" by the dozen, put up jelly, and sewed on blue jackets with tireless industry; while Christie proclaimed that if she had twenty lovers she would send them all; and then made preparations enough to nurse the entire party.
3853_163249_000061_000001.wav|But Christie stood aloof, looking at her lover with something more than admiration in the face that kindled beautifully as she exclaimed:
3853_163249_000122_000000.wav|"Glad and proud to do it." "With no doubt, no fear, to mar your consent." "Not one, David." "That's true love, Christie!"
3853_163249_000036_000000.wav|"I mean it as honestly as you do.
3853_163249_000117_000000.wav|"I'll keep it, David."
3853_163249_000033_000004.wav|He's a kind, neighborly man, and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully.
3853_163249_000132_000000.wav|"But they are mourning flowers, you know."
3853_163249_000058_000000.wav|"I've done it, mother: tell me you're not sorry."
3853_163249_000156_000000.wav|How time went that day!
3853_163249_000015_000002.wav|What shall you choose, Davy?"
3853_163249_000064_000000.wav|When the deed was once done, it was astonishing what satisfaction they all took in it, how soon they got accustomed to the change, and what pride they felt in "our soldier." The loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women, and they could not do too much for their country.
3853_163249_000143_000001.wav|Isn't it fitter for a soldier's wife than lace and silk at such a time as this?"
3853_163249_000124_000004.wav|Can you bear it, love?"
3853_163249_000139_000001.wav|But first"--and Christie held her friend close a moment, kissed her tenderly, and whispered in a broken voice: "Remember, I don't take his heart from you, I only share it with my sister and my mother."
3853_163249_000103_000001.wav|I be, I be!" and the inconsistent woman fell upon his buttony breast weeping copiously.
3853_163249_000093_000001.wav|Ah! but it was that old mother worked and waited for so long: blind now, and deaf; childish, and half dead with many hardships, but safe and free at last; and Hepsey's black face was full of a pride, a peace, and happiness more eloquent and touching than any speech or sermon ever uttered.

5338_284437_000008_000001.wav|Did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences?" asked the woman, evidently surprised.

5338_284437_000050_000000.wav|"I know," answered Tourmaline; "but I hope such a responsibility will not fall upon my shoulders.
5338_284437_000049_000001.wav|It is your duty."
5338_284437_000045_000001.wav|Your Sky Island ain't very big, so when we couldn't stay in the Blue Country, where ever'body hated us, or in the Fog Bank, which ain't healthy an' is too wet for humans to live in for long, we nat'rally were forced to enter the Pink Country, where we expected to find nice people."
5338_284437_000036_000000.wav|"I did not choose to be the Queen," answered Tourmaline, simply.
5338_284437_000011_000000.wav|"These intruders are very peculiar people," remarked a man in the crowd.
5338_284437_000031_000000.wav|"In that case," said Button Bright, "you're entitled to the best there is, to pay for your trouble.
5338_284437_000028_000000.wav|"Why?" asked Tourmaline, curiously.
5338_284437_000054_000002.wav|But, if there is no other way, I may be obliged to call upon Rosalie for help.
5338_284437_000015_000001.wav|Her expression was patient and resigned as she faced her audience.
5338_284437_000024_000000.wav|"By no means," was the prompt reply.
5338_284437_000012_000000.wav|"They seem very ignorant, poor things!" said another, in reply.
5338_284437_000031_000002.wav|Your folks ought to treat you with great respect, as Trot says."
5338_284437_000025_000000.wav|"What shall I call her, then?" inquired Cap'n Bill.
5338_284437_000034_000002.wav|That is my reward."

6241_61946_000036_000003.wav|At length the sturdy little pony, spreading out his legs, in a stiff and ludicrous attitude, got from under the Professor's legs, and left him standing, with both feet on a separate stone, like the Colossus of Rhodes.
6241_61946_000012_000001.wav|It contains thirty thousand square miles of surface, and has about seventy thousand inhabitants.
6241_61946_000018_000004.wav|I should have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some sort of exercise.
6241_61946_000011_000001.wav|Our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord, without requiring whip or spur.
6241_61946_000015_000002.wav|My uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging forward his steed by whip, spur, or voice.
6241_61946_000021_000000.wav|A few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally.
6241_61946_000011_000002.wav|My uncle and I came behind, cutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals.
6241_61946_000025_000000.wav|Hans stopped here one half hour.
6241_61946_000018_000005.wav|My arms are right-but my legs are getting a little stiff."
6241_61946_000015_000001.wav|Our horses, however, appeared not only well acquainted with the country, but by a kind of instinct, knew which was the best road.
6241_61946_000023_000000.wav|Little did I expect, however, the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of Sneffels, where agglomerations of nature's ruins form a kind of terrible chaos.
6241_61946_000046_000000.wav|"Of course I understand-we must wait till the tide serves."
6241_61946_000022_000002.wav|In reality, the great volcanic movement of the island, and all its attendant phenomena, are concentrated in the interior of the island; there, horizontal layers or strata of rocks, piled one upon the other, eruptions of basaltic origin, and streams of lava, have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation.
6241_61946_000016_000000.wav|"Good beast, good beast," he would cry.
6241_61946_000021_000001.wav|What, then, must we expect when we come to the upheaved regions-to the districts broken and roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions?
6241_61946_000035_000000.wav|But my uncle was in no humor to wait.
6241_61946_000018_000001.wav|Look at Hans.
6241_61946_000005_000000.wav|The weather was overcast but settled, when we commenced our adventurous and perilous journey.
6241_61946_000019_000003.wav|In this country there are no roads, paths are nearly unknown, and vegetation, poor as it was, slowly as it reached perfection, soon obliterated all traces of the few travelers who passed from place to place.
6241_61946_000016_000003.wav|He is brave; he is sober; he is safe; he never makes a false step; never glides or slips from his path.
6241_61946_000039_000000.wav|"What, a ferry boat!"
6241_61946_000018_000003.wav|Besides, if he were to complain of weariness, he could have the loan of my horse.
6241_61946_000005_000002.wav|It was, in fact, real tourist weather.
6241_61946_000049_000000.wav|My uncle frowned, stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where the boat lay.
6241_61943_000030_000001.wav|We have only to go down-but, as far as I am concerned, that is not the question.
6241_61943_000023_000000.wav|Then without further remark, he put his finger to his lips, frowned darkly, and descended into the small boat which awaited us.
6241_61943_000039_000004.wav|I saw but few inhabitants during my excursion, but I met a crowd on the beach, drying, salting and loading codfish, the principal article of exportation.
6241_61943_000030_000002.wav|I want to know how we are to get up again."
6241_61943_000034_000000.wav|I bowed by way of reply, put on my hat and furred cloak, and went out.
6241_61943_000015_000001.wav|At all events, we shall get there some day."
6241_61943_000035_000002.wav|A vast field of lava skirts it on one side, falling away in terraces towards the sea.
6241_61943_000020_000000.wav|My uncle came out of his cabin pale, haggard, thin, but full of enthusiasm, his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction.
6241_61943_000009_000000.wav|"Sublime madman," thought I, "you doubtless would approve our proceedings.
6241_61943_000018_000005.wav|From that moment the schooner was steered to the westward in order to round Cape Reykjanes, the western point of Iceland.
6241_61943_000039_000000.wav|In three hours my tour was complete.
6241_61943_000017_000001.wav|I bore it very well, but my uncle to his great annoyance, and even shame, was remarkably seasick!
6241_61943_000031_000000.wav|"That is the least part of the business, and does not in any way trouble me.
6241_61943_000036_000002.wav|The other street, situated more to the west, runs toward a little lake between the residences of the bishop and the other personages not engaged in commerce.
6241_61943_000039_000005.wav|The men appeared robust but heavy; fair haired like Germans, but of pensive mien-exiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the Eskimos, but, I thought, much more unhappy, since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the Polar Circle.
6241_61943_000012_000000.wav|"How long will the voyage last?" asked my uncle.
6241_61943_000035_000001.wav|The town lies on a flat and marshy plain, between two hills.
6241_61943_000032_000000.wav|"In the meanwhile," I replied, "I will take a walk through the town. Will you not likewise do so?"
6241_61943_000035_000005.wav|They were now, however, absent on duty.
6241_61943_000020_000001.wav|Nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land.
6241_61943_000033_000001.wav|"What for me is curious in this island, is not what is above the surface, but what is below."
6241_61943_000008_000000.wav|A few minutes afterwards, the schooner started before the wind, under all the canvas she could carry, and entered the channel.
6241_61943_000006_000000.wav|"Well, and have we a fair wind?" cried my uncle, in his most mellifluous accents.
6241_61943_000008_000002.wav|My uncle was delighted; for myself, moody and dissatisfied, I appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of Hamlet.
6241_61943_000018_000000.wav|On the eleventh day we sighted Cape Portland, over which towered Mount Myrdals Yokul, which, the weather being clear, we made out very readily. The cape itself is nothing but a huge mount of granite standing naked and alone to meet the Atlantic waves.
6241_61943_000037_000000.wav|I had soon seen all I wanted of these weary and dismal thoroughfares. Here and there was a strip of discolored turf, like an old worn out bit of woolen carpet; and now and then a bit of kitchen garden, in which grew potatoes, cabbage, and lettuce, almost diminutive enough to suggest the idea of Lilliput.
6241_61943_000004_000000.wav|The hour of departure came at last.
6241_61943_000011_000002.wav|Her cargo was coal, furniture, pottery, woolen clothing, and a load of corn.
6241_61943_000038_000001.wav|Though not very large, it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries.
6241_61943_000038_000000.wav|In the centre of the new commercial street, I found the public cemetery, enclosed by an earthen wall.
6241_61943_000011_000000.wav|The castle of Kronborg soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere, as well as the tower of Helsinborg, which raises its head on the Swedish Bank. And here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the Kattegat.
6241_61943_000029_000001.wav|Here we are in Iceland.
6241_61943_000026_000000.wav|Out of three rooms of which his house was composed, two were placed at our service, and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage, the amount of which rather astonished the simple inhabitants of Reykjavik.
6241_61943_000040_000001.wav|Their costume consists of a coarse capote of black wool, known in Scandinavian countries as the "vadmel," a broad brimmed hat, trousers of red serge, and a piece of leather tied with strings for a shoe-a coarse kind of moccasin.
6241_61943_000018_000003.wav|After some hours we came in sight of a solitary rock in the ocean, forming a mighty vault, through which the foaming waves poured with intense fury.
6241_61943_000040_000000.wav|Sometimes they gave vent to a convulsive laugh, but by no chance did they smile.
6241_61943_000024_000001.wav|He was, however, but a civil servant, a magistrate, the governor of the island-Baron Trampe.
6241_61943_000010_000001.wav|The fact is, the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of Denmark.
6241_61943_000003_000000.wav|Our Voyage to Iceland
6241_61943_000030_000000.wav|"Well, sir, to a certain extent you are right.
6241_61943_000031_000002.wav|I am about to visit the public library.
6241_61943_000038_000004.wav|I have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out, to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation.
6241_61943_000038_000005.wav|Upon an eminence close at hand was the national school, in which were taught Hebrew, English, French, and Danish.
6241_61943_000031_000004.wav|I shall be glad to consult them."
6241_61943_000002_000000.wav|CHAPTER six
6241_61943_000017_000000.wav|The voyage offered no incident worthy of record.
6241_61943_000009_000001.wav|You might perhaps even follow us to the centre of the earth, there to resolve your eternal doubts."
6241_61943_000028_000000.wav|"How the worse difficulty over?" I cried in fresh amazement.
6241_61943_000039_000002.wav|No trees, no vegetation, so to speak-on all sides volcanic peaks-the huts of turf and earth-more like roofs than houses.
6241_61943_000011_000003.wav|As usual, the crew was small, five Danes doing the whole of the work.
6241_66616_000012_000001.wav|Those who were left moved to the vicinity of the Post.
6241_66616_000004_000000.wav|CHAPTER two
6241_66616_000009_000001.wav|Minnetaki herself replied to this ultimatum.
6241_66616_000008_000004.wav|From the beginning Minnetaki returned the young factor's affections, but a most potent reason prevented their marriage.
6241_66616_000017_000002.wav|The passing of each day became a painful task to him.
6241_66616_000021_000001.wav|It was accompanied by one from the factor himself, another from the princess mother, and by a tiny note from Minnetaki, who pleaded with the others that Roderick and mrs Drew might spend the winter with them at Wabinosh House.
6241_66616_000023_000004.wav|In the end they came to an understanding.
6241_66616_000019_000000.wav|There were now few lonely hours for the two boys.
6241_66616_000022_000006.wav|We have everything here."
6241_66616_000006_000002.wav|But this power of discernment was denied them, and only in after years, with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them, was the whole picture revealed.
6241_66616_000024_000001.wav|On the tenth of October he would meet Rod at Sprucewood, on the Black Sturgeon River.
6241_66616_000024_000004.wav|Not until the eleventh did he arrive at Sprucewood.
6241_66616_000022_000003.wav|The country is alive with them, and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken. Two winters ago I killed forty and I did not make a business of it at that.
6241_66616_000012_000004.wav|The feud still existed.
6241_66616_000022_000002.wav|We will hunt wolves.
6241_66616_000006_000000.wav|Had the young hunters the power of looking into the future, their camp fire that night on the frozen Ombabika might have been one of their last, and a few days later would have seen them back on the edges of civilization.
6241_66616_000008_000002.wav|If there is such a thing as love at first sight, it sprang into existence the moment john Newsome's eyes fell upon this lovely princess.
7641_96684_000033_000000.wav|He left the palace of Admetus and he went to the temple of the gods.
7641_96684_000020_000002.wav|And the words he had spoken he would have taken back-the words that had brought her consent to go with Death in his place.
7641_96684_000015_000003.wav|The sightless man, with howls and shrieks, said he would not go.
7641_96684_000031_000002.wav|How noble it was of Admetus to bring him into his house and give entertainment to him while such sorrow was upon him.
7641_96684_000023_000002.wav|This was Heracles-Heracles come to visit him, but come at a sad hour.
7641_96684_000046_000000.wav|"This I cannot do," said Admetus.
7641_96684_000014_000001.wav|And then he came upon an ancient woman who sat upon stones in the courtyard, grinding corn between two stones.
7641_96684_000031_000003.wav|And then Heracles felt that another labor was before him.
7641_96684_000014_000002.wav|Long had she been doing that wearisome labor. Admetus had known her from the first time he had come into that courtyard as a little child, and he had never seen aught in her face but a heavy misery.
7641_96684_000026_000002.wav|It was a pity, he thought, that Admetus was not feasting with him.
7641_96684_000026_000003.wav|But this was only the first of many feasts.
7641_96684_000012_000004.wav|Thou art well loved, and it may be that thou wilt find one to take thy place."
7641_96684_000008_000001.wav|A radiant figure it was, and Admetus knew that this was Apollo come to him again.
7641_96684_000018_000002.wav|It was not so terrible for him as before.
7641_96684_000026_000001.wav|He put a wreath upon his head and sat down to the feast.
7641_96684_000020_000001.wav|Then, watching over her, he knew that not he but Alcestis would go with Death.
7641_96684_000032_000001.wav|Why should I not strive with Death?
7641_96684_000010_000002.wav|"Admetus, Admetus," he said, "it is for me to tell you that you may no more look on the blue sky nor walk upon the green earth.
7641_96684_000027_000000.wav|"Why is the house of Admetus so hushed to day?" Heracles asked.
7641_96684_000041_000000.wav|"For my sake take her into your house," said Heracles.
7641_96684_000032_000000.wav|"I have dragged up from the Underworld," he thought, "the hound that guards those whom Death brings down into the realm of the god of the Underworld.
7641_96684_000004_000002.wav|But he treated him in friendly wise, and Apollo was happy whilst serving Admetus.
7641_96684_000003_000002.wav|And as a mortal Apollo sought to earn his bread amongst men.
7641_96684_000004_000000.wav|For a year Apollo served the young king, minding his herds of black cattle.
7641_96684_000042_000002.wav|But Heracles pleaded with him, and he took her by the hand.
7641_96684_000029_000000.wav|"Ah, the sacrifice that the king is making," said Heracles.
7641_96684_000012_000002.wav|If one will go willingly in thy place with Death, thou canst still live on.
7641_96684_000039_000002.wav|I won her from an enemy.
7641_96684_000005_000001.wav|It was the god's kindly thought of him that gave him such happiness.
7641_96684_000039_000001.wav|Here is a woman whom I am bringing back to her husband.
7641_96684_000023_000004.wav|And yet Heracles might be on his way from the accomplishment of some great labor, and it would not be right to say a word that might turn him away from his doorway; he might have much need of rest and refreshment.
7641_96684_000012_000001.wav|Thou hast been given a chance more than any mortal man.
7641_96684_000035_000001.wav|"You are held by me, and the god of the Underworld will be-made angry because you cannot go about his business-either this business or any other business.
7641_96684_000047_000001.wav|Then Admetus raised the veil of the woman he had taken across the threshold of his house.
7641_96684_000003_000000.wav|It happened once that Zeus would punish Apollo, his son.
7641_96684_000021_000006.wav|No more speech came from her.
7641_96684_000042_000001.wav|He thought that he could not bear to take her hand.
7641_96684_000021_000003.wav|He lifted Alcestis from the bed and he carried her from the palace.
7641_96684_000029_000001.wav|"To what god is that sacrifice due?"
7641_96684_000035_000000.wav|"Now you are held by me, Death," cried Heracles.
7641_96684_000012_000003.wav|Go, Admetus.
7641_96684_000034_000000.wav|Heracles watched and Death came.
7641_96684_000042_000000.wav|A pang came to Admetus as he looked at the woman who stood beside Heracles and saw that she was the same stature as his lost wife.
7641_96684_000038_000003.wav|She was veiled, and Admetus could not see her features.
7641_96684_000039_000003.wav|Will you not take her into your house while I am away on a journey?"
7641_96684_000008_000003.wav|But Apollo turned to Admetus a face that was without joy.
7641_96684_000023_000003.wav|He could not now rejoice in the company of Heracles.
7641_96684_000021_000004.wav|He carried her to the temple of the gods.
7641_96684_000014_000000.wav|So Admetus thought as he went toward the palace.
7641_96684_000009_000000.wav|"What years of happiness have been mine, O Apollo, through your friendship for me," said Admetus.
7641_96684_000015_000000.wav|But when she heard the name of Death horror came into the face of the ancient woman, and she cried out that she would not let Death come near her.
7641_96684_000047_000003.wav|He looked again upon his wife brought back from the grip of Death by Heracles, the son of Zeus.
7641_96684_000008_000002.wav|He went toward the god and he made reverence and began to speak to him.
7641_96684_000014_000003.wav|There she was sitting as he had first known her, with her eyes bleared and her knees shaking, and with the dust of the courtyard and the husks of the corn in her matted hair.
7641_96684_000047_000004.wav|And then a deeper joy than he had ever known came to Admetus.
7641_96684_000018_000003.wav|He sprang up, and he took the hands of Alcestis and he said, "You, then, will take my place?"
7641_96684_000017_000002.wav|Alcestis spoke to him slowly and gravely.
7641_96684_000011_000000.wav|Then the light of the world went out for Admetus, and he heard himself speaking to Apollo in a shaking voice: "O Apollo, Apollo, thou art a god, and surely thou canst save me!
7641_96684_000021_000002.wav|No, not here, for he would not have Death come into the palace.
7641_96684_000043_000000.wav|"Now take her across your threshold, Admetus," said Heracles.
7641_96684_000010_000004.wav|Admetus, Admetus, know that even now the god of the Underworld is sending Death for you."
7641_96684_000016_000000.wav|Then Admetus went into the palace and into the chamber where his bed was, and he lay down upon the bed and he lamented that he would have to go with Death that was coming for him from the god of the Underworld, and he lamented that none of the wretched ones around the palace would take his place.
7641_96684_000018_000001.wav|Now the footsteps seemed to stop.
7641_96684_000017_000000.wav|A hand was laid upon him.
7641_96684_000024_000000.wav|Thinking this Admetus went up to Heracles and took his hand and welcomed him into his house.
7641_96684_000007_000003.wav|This was a feat that no hero had been able to accomplish.
7641_96684_000010_000003.wav|It is for me to tell you that the god of the Underworld will have you come to him.

7641_96252_000004_000008.wav|It is conceivable that a perfect state, or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believed doctrine of rewards and punishments after death, might prevent every crime; politically much would be gained thereby; morally, nothing; only the expression of the will in life would be restricted.

7641_96252_000008_000004.wav|There are certainly individuals who merely seem to have a good disposition on account of the weakness of the will appearing in them, but what they are soon appears from the fact that they are not capable of any remarkable self conquest in order to perform a just or good deed.

7641_96252_000009_000002.wav|The merely just man is content not to cause it; and, in general, most men know and are acquainted with innumerable sufferings of others in their vicinity, but do not determine to mitigate them, because to do so would involve some self denial on their part.
7641_96252_000012_000000.wav|Thus, though others have set up moral principles which they give out as prescriptions for virtue, and laws which it was necessary to follow, I, as has already been said, cannot do this because I have no "ought" or law to prescribe to the eternally free will.

1630_141772_000011_000002.wav|During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak.

1630_141772_000031_000001.wav|So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.

1630_141772_000025_000000.wav|After looking at him Napoleon smiled.
1630_141772_000034_000000.wav|His face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure.
1630_141772_000029_000001.wav|Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet "young man" that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.
1630_141772_000040_000000.wav|"He is a nervous, bilious subject," said Larrey, "and will not recover."

1630_141772_000002_000000.wav|He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking French.
1630_141772_000011_000000.wav|Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.
1630_141772_000008_000001.wav|He heard the speaker addressed as Sire.
1630_141772_000030_000001.wav|"How do you feel, mon brave?"

1630_96099_000007_000001.wav|My man should be here by now, and I will instruct him at once.

1630_96099_000021_000002.wav|I was much surprised, but he told me his business often brought him here.

1630_96099_000008_000000.wav|"The inspector is there," said the guard, pointing to the outer room.
1630_96099_000014_000003.wav|I have lost him!"
1630_96099_000034_000001.wav|I have done wrong, I confess.
1630_96099_000012_000001.wav|His face wore a look of hot, flurried excitement, and his manner was one of abject, cringing self abasement.
1630_96099_000018_000003.wav|It is that, or your great gluttony.
1630_96099_000014_000000.wav|"Alas, monsieur!

1630_96099_000045_000001.wav|how?" asked the Chief, gruffly, but obviously much interested.
1630_96099_000036_000000.wav|"He was so artful," went on Block in further extenuation of his offence.
1630_96099_000048_000000.wav|"He was much pressed, in a great hurry.
1630_96099_000011_000000.wav|"Block?
1630_96099_000014_000002.wav|He has gone-disappeared!
1630_96099_000012_000000.wav|When Block appeared, it was evident that something had gone wrong with him.
1630_96099_000043_000001.wav|Of course, such a consummate ass as you have proved yourself would not think of searching the restaurant or the immediate neighbourhood, or of making inquiries as to whether he had been seen, or as to which way he had gone?"
1630_96099_000031_000000.wav|"I did think of it, monsieur, but then, he, the Italian, was just the same as myself.
1630_96099_000048_000001.wav|Directly he crossed the threshold he called the first cab and was driving away, but he was stopped-"
1630_96099_000043_000000.wav|"You will have to find him, Block, and that speedily, within twenty four hours,--to day, indeed,--or I will break you like a stick, and send you into the gutter.

1630_96099_000005_000000.wav|"That should be at once," remarked the Commissary, eager, as usual, for decisive action.

1630_96099_000020_000000.wav|"No doubt," growled the Chief.
1630_96099_000055_000001.wav|Her face-it was a policeman who saw her, and he said she was good looking, dark, brunette, black hair."
1630_96099_000054_000000.wav|"Tell me," said the Chief, "quick, this woman-what was she like? Did you get her description?"
1630_96099_000013_000000.wav|"What is it?" asked the little Chief, sharply.
1630_96099_000017_000004.wav|We are apt at times to expect others to be intuitively possessed of knowledge that has only come to us at a much later date.
1630_96099_000015_000001.wav|You cannot mean it!
1630_96099_000009_000001.wav|You mean arrived."
1630_96099_000044_000001.wav|I have been unfortunate, a victim to circumstances, still I believe I know my duty.
1630_96099_000047_000000.wav|"Hah! that is greatly against him indeed."
1630_96099_000030_000000.wav|"And what of your duty, your service, pray?"
1630_96099_000008_000001.wav|"He has just returned."

1630_96099_000022_000000.wav|"Get on, get on! come to the essential."
1630_96099_000031_000003.wav|I suspected nothing when he brought out his pocketbook,--it was stuffed full, monsieur; I saw that and my confidence increased,--called for the reckoning, and paid with an Italian bank note.
1630_96099_000027_000000.wav|"Forgive me, monsieur, but it is all part of my story.
1630_96099_000056_000000.wav|"It is the maid herself!" cried the little Chief, springing up and slapping his thigh in exuberant glee.
1630_96099_000024_000000.wav|"And you-greedy, gormandizing beast!--you agreed?"
1630_96099_000026_000000.wav|"How often must I tell you to get on?"
1630_96099_000015_000002.wav|Gone, now, just when we most want him?
1630_96099_000007_000000.wav|"I will charge myself with it, certainly.
1630_96099_000052_000000.wav|"Yes, monsieur.
1630_96099_000033_000001.wav|Why did you not follow him?
1630_96099_000029_000000.wav|"It was all this that helped me to my destruction.
1630_96099_000049_000001.wav|Why did they not keep him, then?"
1630_96099_000036_000001.wav|"He left everything behind.
1630_96099_000031_000005.wav|A minute after, my man got up, saying:
1630_96099_000034_000002.wav|But then, who was to tell he meant to run away?"
1630_96099_000018_000001.wav|Explain.
1630_96099_000015_000000.wav|"Impossible!

116_288048_000018_000001.wav|The immediate companions of Jesus appear to be, on the other hand, as mythical as he is himself.
116_288048_000028_000011.wav|Moreover, if Jesus could keep his promise, there would be today no misery in the world, no orphans, no childless mothers, no shipwrecks, no floods, no famines, no disease, no crippled children, no insanity, no wars, no crime, no wrong!

116_288048_000013_000008.wav|In other words, the only proofs Origin can bring forth against the rationalistic criticism of Celsus is, that to deny Jesus would be equivalent to denying both the Pagan and Jewish mythologies.
116_288048_000028_000015.wav|Can the followers of Jesus move mountains, drink deadly poisons, touch serpents, or work greater miracles than are ascribed to Jesus, as it was promised that they would do?

116_288048_000017_000000.wav|To help their cause the Christian apologists not infrequently also changed the sense of certain Old Testament passages to make them support the miraculous stories in the New Testament.

116_288048_000001_000000.wav|Let me now give an idea of the method I propose to follow in the study of this subject.
116_288048_000029_000000.wav|George Jacob Holyoake, of England, tells how in the days of utter poverty, his believing mother asked the Lord, again and again-on her knees, with tears streaming from her eyes, and with absolute faith in Jesus' ability to keep His promise,--to give her starving children their daily bread.
116_288048_000028_000016.wav|How many self deluded prophets these extravagant claims have produced!
116_288048_000029_000007.wav|"It never struck me," continues mr Holyoake, "that the preacher's threadbare dress, his half famished look, and necessity of taking up a collection the previous night to pay expenses showed that faith was not a source of income to him.

116_288048_000019_000005.wav|In one or two places, in the New Testament, Jesus is made to send out "the seventy" to evangelize the world.
116_288048_000026_000000.wav|The report that Jesus was God is equally impossible of verification. How are we to prove whether or not a certain person was God?

116_288048_000005_000004.wav|Such expressions in our language as "ill starred," "a lucky star," "disaster," "lunacy," and so on, indicate the hold which astrology once enjoyed upon the human mind.
116_288048_000005_000003.wav|The belief that the stars determine human destinies is a very ancient one.
116_288048_000013_000011.wav|There could not be a more damaging admission than this from one of the most conspicuous defenders of Jesus' story against early criticism.
116_288048_000028_000017.wav|And who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises?
116_288048_000013_000001.wav|This is so important that we refer our readers to Origin's own words on the subject.
116_288048_000022_000007.wav|And he was unknown to them because no such Jesus existed in their day.
116_288048_000003_000002.wav|There has been considerable confusion and contradiction about it.

116_288048_000022_000002.wav|It is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of Jesus, the authors and historians of his time, do not take notice of him.
116_288048_000016_000001.wav|All he seems to ask for is that Jesus be given a higher place among the divinities of the ancient world.
116_288048_000010_000004.wav|The theologian might say that this little difficulty was introduced purposely into the scriptures to establish its infallibility, but it is only religious books that are pronounced infallible on the strength of the contradictions they contain.

116_288048_000019_000000.wav|The report that Jesus had twelve apostles seems also mythical.
116_288048_000003_000001.wav|There has never been any unanimity about this matter.
116_288048_000008_000005.wav|Hence, if the shepherds sleeping in the fields really saw the heavens open and heard the angel song, in all probability it was in some other month of the year, and not late in December.
116_288048_000007_000000.wav|This uncertainty robs the story of Jesus, to an extent at least, of the atmosphere of reality.
116_288047_000004_000001.wav|This was imaginary knowledge, which travel and research have corrected.
116_288047_000002_000002.wav|Observing the sun, the moon, and the stars overhead, the primitive man wished to account for them.

116_288047_000002_000009.wav|A myth, then, is a guess, a story, a speculation, or a fanciful explanation of a phenomenon, in the absence of accurate information.

116_288045_000012_000000.wav|"No, no," he replied, raising his hand to command silence, "Apollo is not a god; he was only an idol."
116_288045_000010_000001.wav|I am a priest."
116_288045_000028_000000.wav|"It was not true."
116_288045_000034_000004.wav|He came to our earth and was born of a virgin."

116_288045_000008_000008.wav|It was Sunday-Sunday before Christmas, and the people were going to "the House of God."
116_288045_000029_000000.wav|"But I still believe in Apollo," I exclaimed; "he is not dead, I know he is alive."
116_288045_000040_000000.wav|"I want to see Jesus," I hastened, turning toward him.
116_288045_000016_000002.wav|Have you seen Apollo?
116_288045_000018_000000.wav|"Do you know of any one who has?"
116_288045_000020_000000.wav|"He was an idol, then, and not a god."
116_288045_000039_000000.wav|But my guide placed his hand quickly upon my shoulder, and held me back.
116_288045_000014_000001.wav|They worshipped gods that did not exist.
116_288045_000008_000006.wav|He understood my bewilderment amid my novel surroundings, and offered to enlighten me.
116_288045_000032_000003.wav|Observing my anxiety to understand the meaning of all this, my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were celebrating the anniversary of the birthday of their beautiful Savior-Jesus, the Son of God.
116_288045_000035_000000.wav|Again I was tempted to tell my guide that that was how Apollo became incarnate; but I restrained myself.
116_288045_000046_000000.wav|"Would not that, then," I ventured to ask, impatiently, "make Jesus as much of an idol as Apollo?
116_288045_000017_000000.wav|"No," I said, in a low voice.
116_288045_000008_000001.wav|He must have realized I was a stranger and wished to tender his hospitality to me.
116_288045_000004_000000.wav|A PARABLE
116_288045_000005_000001.wav|I have been dead for nearly as many years.
116_288045_000031_000010.wav|No, no, Apollo is not an idol.
116_288045_000008_000000.wav|Looking about me I saw a gentleman in a neat black dress, smiling, and his hand extended to me with great cordiality.
116_288045_000045_000000.wav|"No," he answered.
116_288045_000030_000001.wav|Produce Apollo and he shall be our god."
116_288045_000014_000002.wav|They built temples to divinities which were merely empty names-empty names," he repeated.
116_288045_000032_000000.wav|By this time we stood at the entrance of a large edifice which my guide said was "the House of God." As we walked in I saw innumerable little lights blinking and winking all over the spacious interior. There were, besides, pictures, altars and images all around me.
116_288045_000030_000000.wav|"Prove it," he said to me; then, pausing for a moment, "if you produce him," he said, "we shall all fall down and worship him.
116_288045_000016_000003.wav|Have you heard him?
116_288045_000031_000000.wav|"Produce him!" I whispered to myself.
116_288045_000031_000005.wav|Homer, whose every word was a drop of light?"
116_288045_000034_000000.wav|"Forget Apollo," he said, with a suggestion of severity in his voice. "There is no such person.
116_288045_000031_000009.wav|"Is it possible," I asked, "that all this is pure fabrication, a fantasy of the brain, as unsubstantial as the air?
116_288045_000005_000000.wav|I am today twenty five hundred years old.
116_288045_000010_000000.wav|"Yes," he answered, "I conduct the worship.
116_288045_000023_000000.wav|"Is he, then, dead?" I asked.
116_288045_000007_000000.wav|"This must be a day of festival and worship, devoted to one of their gods," I murmured to myself.
116_288045_000024_000000.wav|"He never lived; and for the last two thousand years or more his temple has been a heap of ruins."
116_288045_000008_000004.wav|He pressed mine.
116_288045_000031_000012.wav|The whole Greek world will bear me witness that I am telling the truth." Then I looked at my guide to see what impression this outburst of sincere enthusiasm had produced upon him, and I saw a cold smile upon his lips that cut me to the heart.
116_288045_000034_000001.wav|He was only an idol.
116_288045_000016_000004.wav|Have you touched him?"
116_288045_000021_000000.wav|"But many of us Greeks," I said, "have felt Apollo in our hearts and have been inspired by him."
116_288045_000042_000000.wav|I was too much surprised at this to make any immediate reply.

1686_142278_000018_000002.wav|The one staid foundation of her home, of her idea of her beloved father, seemed reeling and rocking.
1686_142278_000031_000004.wav|Margaret was almost overpowered with the idea that her mother knew nothing of it all, and yet the affair was so far advanced!
1686_142278_000013_000001.wav|It is all myself.
1686_142278_000061_000000.wav|'Poor Maria!' replied mr Hale, tenderly.
1686_142278_000034_000000.wav|'Milton Northern!
1686_142278_000049_000005.wav|But I felt sure of sympathy from mr Bell.
1686_142278_000013_000003.wav|I will answer any questions this once, but after to night let us never speak of it again.
1686_142278_000008_000001.wav|Do tell me!'
1686_142278_000010_000000.wav|'Because I must no longer be a minister in the Church of England.'
1686_142278_000023_000000.wav|'But, father,' said she, suddenly lifting up her flushed, tear wet face, 'the early martyrs suffered for the truth, while you-oh!
1686_142278_000047_000000.wav|mr Hale continued: 'A few months ago, when my misery of doubt became more than I could bear without speaking, I wrote to mr Bell-you remember mr Bell, Margaret?'
1686_142278_000048_000002.wav|Frederick's godfather-your old tutor at Oxford, don't you mean?'
1686_142278_000057_000000.wav|Margaret was almost stunned.
1686_142278_000000_000001.wav|The house was shut up for the evening.
1686_142278_000020_000001.wav|His trials are over.
1686_142278_000018_000001.wav|Oh! it seems so terrible, so shocking,' said Margaret, suddenly bursting into tears.
1686_142278_000028_000004.wav|There is a curate appointed to read prayers-a mr Brown.
1686_142278_000015_000001.wav|Margaret sighed, as if standing on the verge of some new horror. He began again, speaking rapidly, as if to get over a set task:
1686_142278_000056_000002.wav|You see, your mother knows nothing about it yet: but I think, in a fortnight;--after my deed of resignation is sent in, I shall have no right to remain.
1686_142278_000004_000000.wav|'Margaret!' said mr Hale, at last, in a sort of sudden desperate way, that made her start.
1686_142278_000058_000000.wav|'In a fortnight!'
1686_142278_000062_000000.wav|'No,' said Margaret, sadly, 'I will do it.
1686_142278_000056_000000.wav|'I do not know exactly.
1686_142278_000011_000007.wav|Frederick was an outlaw.
1686_142278_000042_000000.wav|mr Hale shook his head despondingly: he pressed her hand in token of gratitude.
1686_142278_000029_000000.wav|Was it to be so sudden then?
1686_142278_000030_000001.wav|At length he stopped and replied:
1686_142278_000018_000004.wav|What was to be done?
1686_142278_000045_000003.wav|Besides, in a country parish I should be so painfully reminded of Helstone, and my duties here.
1686_142278_000011_000002.wav|But nothing to the shock she received from mr Hale's last speech.
1686_142278_000060_000000.wav|'Yes, papa, it had better be fixed soon and decidedly, as you say.
1686_142278_000060_000002.wav|It is that that is the great perplexity.'
1686_142278_000006_000001.wav|But why?'
1686_142278_000053_000002.wav|Some want their children to be better instructed than they themselves have been.
1686_142278_000059_000001.wav|Nothing is fixed,' said her father, with anxious hesitation, as he noticed the filmy sorrow that came over her eyes, and the sudden change in her complexion.
1686_142278_000011_000000.wav|Margaret had imagined nothing less than that some of the preferments which her mother so much desired had befallen her father at last-something that would force him to leave beautiful, beloved Helstone, and perhaps compel him to go and live in some of the stately and silent Closes which Margaret had seen from time to time in cathedral towns.
1686_142278_000044_000000.wav|'Frederick must not suffer,' said Margaret, decidedly; 'in a foreign country; so unjustly treated by his own.
1686_142278_000000_000000.wav|He was gone.
1686_142278_000049_000009.wav|And it is owing to him we are going to Milton.'
1686_142278_000044_000003.wav|Oh!
1686_142278_000045_000004.wav|I could not bear it, Margaret.
1686_142278_000040_000000.wav|Margaret did dislike it, did shrink from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before.
1686_142278_000046_000000.wav|Margaret resolved to keep silence.
1686_142278_000031_000001.wav|I cannot bear to give pain.
1686_142278_000039_000005.wav|Would you dislike breaking it to her very much, Margaret?'
1686_142278_000054_000002.wav|Discordant as it was-with almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the North of England, the manufacturers, the people, the wild and bleak country-there was this one recommendation-it would be different from Helstone, and could never remind them of that beloved place.
1686_142278_000064_000004.wav|As her fingers were on the handle he called her back.
1686_142278_000044_000004.wav|I think we could.'
1686_142278_000043_000002.wav|Seventy of that has always gone to Frederick, since he has been abroad.
1686_142278_000054_000001.wav|It would be different.
1686_142278_000002_000000.wav|Her mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was adjusted into anything like order.
1686_142278_000024_000003.wav|It is not a month since the bishop offered me another living; if I had accepted it, I should have had to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the Liturgy at my institution.
1686_142278_000000_000003.wav|Margaret went up to dress for the early tea, finding Dixon in a pretty temper from the interruption which a visitor had naturally occasioned on a busy day.
1686_142278_000049_000003.wav|At any rate, he has property there, which has very much increased in value since Milton has become such a large manufacturing town.
1686_142278_000027_000002.wav|But when?'
1686_142278_000049_000006.wav|I don't know that he gave me much strength.
1686_142278_000003_000002.wav|Margaret was preparing her mother's worsted work, and rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening, and wishing bed time were come that she might go over the events of the day again.
1686_142278_000025_000001.wav|At last he said,
1686_142278_000021_000001.wav|When God will not use thee in one kind, yet He will in another.
1686_142278_000018_000006.wav|He swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto, and going to his bookcase he took down a volume, which he had often been reading lately, and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked.
1686_142278_000002_000004.wav|She forgot that he had not made them an offer.
1686_142278_000020_000003.wav|Then he read aloud,--
1686_142278_000059_000002.wav|But she recovered herself immediately.
1686_142278_000053_000003.wav|At any rate, there is an opening, as I have said, for a private tutor.
1686_142278_000028_000005.wav|He will come to stay with us to morrow.
1686_142278_000035_000000.wav|'Yes,' said he, in the same despondent, indifferent way.
1686_142278_000042_000001.wav|Margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying.
1686_142278_000011_000006.wav|Could he have become implicated in anything Frederick had done?
1686_142278_000037_000000.wav|'Because there I can earn bread for my family.
1686_142278_000021_000007.wav|As he read this, and glanced at much more which he did not read, he gained resolution for himself, and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right; but as he ceased he heard Margaret's low convulsive sob; and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering.
1686_142278_000045_000000.wav|'No!' said mr Hale. 'That would not answer.
1686_142278_000016_000000.wav|'You could not understand it all, if I told you-my anxiety, for years past, to know whether I had any right to hold my living-my efforts to quench my smouldering doubts by the authority of the Church.
1686_142278_000042_000003.wav|You and mamma have some money, independent of the income from the living, have not you?
1686_142278_000024_000004.wav|Margaret, I tried to do it; I tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment, and stopping quietly here,--strangling my conscience now, as I had strained it before.
1686_142278_000044_000001.wav|A hundred is left.
1686_142278_000012_000003.wav|Surely, if the bishop were told all we know about Frederick, and the hard, unjust-'
1686_142278_000064_000003.wav|Then she arose and went, without another word or look, towards the door.
1686_142278_000005_000003.wav|He made her take a chair by him; he stirred the fire, snuffed the candles, and sighed once or twice before he could make up his mind to say-and it came out with a jerk after all-'Margaret!
1686_142278_000045_000001.wav|I must do something.
1686_142278_000029_000001.wav|thought Margaret; and yet perhaps it was as well.
1686_142278_000045_000006.wav|No: we must go to Milton.
1686_142278_000039_000000.wav|'You shall be told all, Margaret.
1686_142278_000056_000001.wav|I wanted to talk it over with you.
1686_142278_000039_000003.wav|If I tell you all, perhaps you could break it to her to morrow.
1686_142278_000011_000003.wav|What could he mean?
1686_142278_000024_000005.wav|God forgive me!'
1686_142278_000045_000009.wav|'I cannot stand objections.
1686_142278_000001_000000.wav|How different men were to women!
1686_142278_000055_000000.wav|'When do we go?' asked Margaret, after a short silence.
1686_142278_000004_000001.wav|'Is that tapestry thing of immediate consequence?
1686_142278_000041_000001.wav|You must have many painful things to do.'
1686_142278_000049_000007.wav|He has lived an easy life in his college all his days.
1686_142278_000024_000001.wav|I have borne long with self reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine.' He shook his head as he went on.
1686_142278_000038_000000.wav|'Bread for your family!
1686_142278_000063_000000.wav|mr Hale sat in rigid stillness while she spoke.
1686_142278_000039_000002.wav|I think I could do anything but that: the idea of her distress turns me sick with dread.
1686_142278_000019_000000.wav|'Listen, dear Margaret,' said he, putting one arm round her waist.
1686_142278_000061_000002.wav|Oh, if I were not married-if I were but myself in the world, how easy it would be!
1686_142278_000049_000000.wav|'Yes.
1686_142278_000021_000002.wav|A soul that desires to serve and honour Him shall never want opportunity to do it; nor must thou so limit the Holy One of Israel as to think He hath but one way in which He can glorify Himself by thee.
1686_142278_000028_000002.wav|I shall have to take my deed of resignation, and wait upon the bishop myself, to bid him farewell.
1686_142278_000026_000000.wav|'Margaret, I return to the old sad burden we must leave Helstone.'
1686_142278_000045_000010.wav|They make me so undecided.'
1686_142278_000013_000004.wav|I can meet the consequences of my painful, miserable doubts; but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much suffering.'
1686_142278_000013_000002.wav|Margaret, I will tell you about it.
1686_142278_000005_000004.wav|I am going to leave Helstone.'
1686_142278_000025_000000.wav|He rose and walked up and down the room, speaking low words of self reproach and humiliation, of which Margaret was thankful to hear but few.
1686_142278_000006_000000.wav|'Leave Helstone, papa!
1686_142278_000024_000002.wav|'Your poor mother's fond wish, gratified at last in the mocking way in which over fond wishes are too often fulfilled-Sodom apples as they are-has brought on this crisis, for which I ought to be, and I hope I am thankful.
1686_142278_000000_000006.wav|She sat by herself at the fire, with unlighted candles on the table behind her, thinking over the day, the happy walk, happy sketching, cheerful pleasant dinner, and the uncomfortable, miserable walk in the garden.
1686_142278_000018_000003.wav|What could she say?
1686_142278_000012_000002.wav|Why can you no longer be a clergyman?
1686_142278_000015_000000.wav|'No! not doubts as to religion; not the slightest injury to that.' He paused.
1686_142278_000039_000001.wav|Only help me to tell your mother.
1686_142278_000048_000000.wav|'No; I never saw him, I think.
1686_142278_000001_000003.wav|Then she took it into her head that, after all, his lightness might be but assumed, to cover a bitterness of disappointment which would have been stamped on her own heart if she had loved and been rejected.
1686_142278_000043_000003.wav|I don't know if he wants it all,' he continued in a hesitating manner.
1686_142278_000000_000005.wav|Yet, after all, Margaret had to wait a long time in the drawing room before her mother came down.
1686_142278_000030_000000.wav|To her surprise, her father began to walk about again before he answered.
1686_142278_000000_000004.wav|She showed it by brushing away viciously at Margaret's hair, under pretence of being in a great hurry to go to mrs Hale.
1686_142278_000004_000002.wav|I mean, can you leave it and come into my study?
1686_142278_000034_000001.wav|The manufacturing town in Darkshire?'
1686_142278_000031_000000.wav|'Margaret, I am a poor coward after all.
1686_142278_000027_000001.wav|I see.
1686_142278_000049_000001.wav|He is a Fellow of Plymouth College there.
1686_142278_000049_000004.wav|Well, I had reason to suspect-to imagine-I had better say nothing about it, however.
1686_142278_000021_000005.wav|Thou wilt have little thanks, O my soul!
1686_142278_000007_000002.wav|Margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense, which was even more distressing to her father than to herself.
1686_142278_000027_000000.wav|'Yes!
1686_142278_000062_000002.wav|You cannot mean that you are really going to leave the Church-to give up Helstone-to be for ever separate from me, from mamma-led away by some delusion-some temptation!
7697_245712_000003_000002.wav|This is signified by the fact that God led the animals to man, that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures.
7697_245712_000000_000006.wav|Secondly, this is proved by the order of Divine Providence which always governs inferior things by the superior.
7697_245712_000028_000001.wav|For Augustine says (De Civ.
7697_245712_000001_000001.wav|Now an angel is naturally higher than man.
7697_245712_000011_000002.wav|Now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject.
7697_245712_000006_000000.wav|Whether Man Had Mastership Over All Other Creatures?
7697_245712_000021_000000.wav|There might also have been bodily disparity.
7697_245712_000011_000003.wav|Wherefore man had no mastership over the angels in the primitive state; so when we read "all creatures," we must understand the creatures which are not made to God's image.
7697_245712_000000_000003.wav|This can be proved in three ways.
7697_245712_000014_000000.wav|Whether Men Were Equal in the State of Innocence?
7697_245712_000015_000002.wav|Therefore all were equal.
7697_245712_000020_000000.wav|Moreover, as regards the soul, there would have been inequality as to righteousness and knowledge.
7697_245712_000000_000001.wav|Therefore in the state of innocence, before man had disobeyed, nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him.
7697_245712_000003_000001.wav|But man needed animals in order to have experimental knowledge of their natures.
7697_245712_000033_000002.wav|First, because man is naturally a social being, and so in the state of innocence he would have led a social life.
7697_245712_000017_000002.wav|Therefore, etc
7697_245712_000011_000006.wav|But of the natural powers and the body itself man is master not by commanding, but by using them.
7697_245712_000011_000005.wav|So in the state of innocence man had mastership over the animals by commanding them.
7697_245712_000001_000002.wav|Therefore certain things in regard to animals could be done by angels, which could not be done by man; for instance, the rapid gathering together of all the animals.
7697_245712_000000_000011.wav|Therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural.
7697_105817_000020_000003.wav|Who knows but that God, who made the world, may cause him to die, or lose the use of his limbs as he did at first.
7697_105817_000019_000003.wav|Shall we let Giant Despair rule us?
7697_105817_000019_000000.wav|Christian.--Friend, what shall we do?
7697_105815_000040_000001.wav|There, they say, is no death; and there I shall dwell with such as love the Lord.
7697_105815_000022_000006.wav|O that I had not slept!
7697_105815_000027_000001.wav|Tell me, whence come you?
7697_105815_000023_000004.wav|But, ere he got to the top, the sun went down on Christian, and he soon saw that two wild beast stood in his way.
7697_105815_000023_000002.wav|He laid it up in the breast of his coat and gave thanks to God.
7697_105815_000023_000005.wav|Ah, thought he, these beasts range in the night for their prey; and if they should meet with me in the dark, how should I fly from them?
7697_105815_000024_000002.wav|Fear not the two wild beasts, for they are bound by chains, and are put here to try the faith of those that have it, and to find out those that have none.
7697_105815_000041_000000.wav|Charity.--Have you a wife and babes?
7697_105815_000051_000000.wav|Then they told him it was Immanuel's Land.
7697_105815_000023_000001.wav|Words are too weak to tell the joy of Christian when he had got back his scroll.
7697_105815_000034_000001.wav|When Watchful told her why Christian had come there, she said: What is your name?
7697_105815_000022_000005.wav|I am made to tread those steps thrice which I need not to have trod but once; yea, now too I am like to be lost in the night, for the day is well nigh spent.

7697_105815_000046_000000.wav|Christian.--Yes, and that with much warmth, for you may think how dear they were to me.
7697_105815_000048_000002.wav|And they brought out the jaw bone of an ass with which Samson did such great feats, and the sling and stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath.
7697_105815_000031_000000.wav|Watchful.--How is it you came so late?
7697_105815_000030_000000.wav|Christian.--My name is now Christian, but at first it was Graceless.
7697_105815_000029_000000.wav|Watchful.--What is your name?
7697_105815_000023_000006.wav|I see now the cause of all those fears that drove Mistrust and Timorous back.
7697_105815_000042_000000.wav|Christian.--Yes, I have.

7697_245715_000008_000001.wav|But in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation.
7697_245715_000020_000002.wav|Therefore also in the state of innocence male and female would have been born.
7697_245715_000006_000002.wav|Therefore, in the state of innocence, children would not have been deprived of the use of their limbs.
7697_245715_000009_000002.wav|Now it is clear that it is as natural as it is befitting to the principles of human nature that children should not have sufficient strength for the use of their limbs immediately after birth.
7697_245715_000019_000002.wav|Therefore, in the state of innocence, there was no need for women to be born.
7697_245715_000009_000004.wav|Wherefore it is natural, on account of the considerable humidity of the brain in children, that the nerves which are instruments of movement, should not be apt for moving the limbs.
7697_245715_000010_000003.wav|But the same acts are not befitting to man at every season of life.
7697_245715_000017_000005.wav|Therefore in that state women would not have been born.
7697_245715_000007_000002.wav|Therefore neither would there have been such weakness in infancy.
7697_245715_000003_000000.wav|Whether in the State of Innocence Children Would Have Had Perfect Strength of Body As to the Use of Its Members Immediately After Birth?
7697_245715_000016_000000.wav|Whether, in the Primitive State, Women Would Have Been Born?
7697_245715_000009_000001.wav|Wherefore, in making any assertion, we must be guided by the nature of things, except in those things which are above nature, and are made known to us by Divine authority.
7697_245715_000008_000002.wav|Therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power.
7697_245715_000017_000004.wav|But in that state nothing would have been unnatural in human generation.
7697_245715_000005_000001.wav|But man is nobler than other animals.
7697_245715_000009_000003.wav|Because in proportion to other animals man has naturally a larger brain.
7697_245715_000004_000003.wav|Therefore neither would there have been weakness of body in infants.
5543_27761_000075_000000.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna tried desperately to amuse Lelechka.
5543_27761_000093_000000.wav|Fever was consuming Lelechka, and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium.
5543_27761_000091_000000.wav|Nothing made her so unhappy as the reiterations of Fedosya, uttered between sobs: "She hid herself and hid herself, our Lelechka!"
5543_27761_000042_000000.wav|"Yes, that's bad," repeated Agathya with conviction.
5543_27761_000114_000001.wav|Fedosya, motionless, with dejected face, sat in a corner, and looked frightened at her mistress; then she suddenly burst out sobbing, and she wailed loudly:
5543_27761_000062_000000.wav|"Of course I know that gentlefolk don't believe in omens, but it's a bad omen, madam," Fedosya went on in a doleful voice, "the young lady will hide, and hide..."
5543_27761_000102_000000.wav|"Lelechka is dead," she said in a quiet, dull voice.
5543_27761_000107_000001.wav|"You must resign yourself to your fate."

5543_27761_000089_000000.wav|A doctor was called, and everything was done that is usual on such occasions-but the inevitable happened.
5543_27761_000050_000000.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna did not even notice that Fedosya came up to her and paused before her.
5543_27761_000077_000000.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna was tormented by presentiments.
5543_27761_000028_000003.wav|One thing Sergey Modestovich had not become reconciled to, and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery.
5543_27761_000029_000001.wav|I knew that I'd find you here," he said with a derisive and condescending smile.
5543_27761_000013_000000.wav|This charming inability to speak always made, Serafima Aleksandrovna smile with tender rapture.
5543_27761_000030_000000.wav|They left the nursery together.
5543_27761_000113_000003.wav|Where is my Lelechka?"
5543_27761_000105_000002.wav|Sergey Modestovich went to his wife and, consoling her with cold, empty words, tried to draw her away from the coffin.
5543_27761_000068_000002.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna, upon reflection, attributed these women's beliefs in omens to ignorance.
5543_27761_000077_000004.wav|She suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness.
5543_27761_000024_000002.wav|Lelechka suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy.
5543_27761_000006_000001.wav|He was always fresh and cool, with a frigid smile, and wherever he passed cold currents seemed to move in the air.

5543_27761_000122_000001.wav|The mother threw herself after the coffin with despairing sobs, but she was held back.
5543_27761_000080_000002.wav|Her mother covered her with a blue blanket. Lelechka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out to embrace her mother.
5543_27761_000028_000000.wav|Sergey Modestovich gave a swift glance round the room.
5543_27761_000112_000000.wav|He took his wife by the arm, and cautiously led her away from the coffin.
5543_27761_000095_000000.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near Lelechka's bed.
5543_27761_000115_000000.wav|"She hid herself, and hid herself, our Lelechka, our angelic little soul!"
5543_27761_000049_000000.wav|Lelechka was asleep, and Serafima Aleksandrovna was sitting in her own room, thinking with joy and tenderness of Lelechka.
5543_27761_000073_000001.wav|Though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded, superstitious dread, nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of Lelechka's favourite game, and she tried to divert Lelechka's attention to something else.
5543_27761_000092_000000.wav|But the thoughts of Serafima Aleksandrovna were confused, and she could not quite grasp what was happening.
5543_27761_000061_000000.wav|She did not wish to hear any further as to the sort of omen it was, and what it foreboded.
5543_27761_000077_000001.wav|She felt ashamed of herself for ceasing to play hide and seek with Lelechka before Fedosya.
5543_27761_000093_000002.wav|Three days passed, torturing like a nightmare. Lelechka grew quite feeble.
5543_27761_000078_000000.wav|It was a sad day for Serafima Aleksandrovna.
5543_27761_000093_000003.wav|She did not know that she was dying.
5543_27761_000027_000000.wav|Sergey Modestovich was coming at this moment toward the nursery. Through the half closed doors he heard the laughter, the joyous outcries, the sound of romping.
5543_27761_000052_000001.wav|Fedosya's face made her anxious.
5543_27761_000100_000000.wav|Something rattled in her throat; Lelechka opened and again closed her rapidly paling lips, and died.
5543_27761_000119_000002.wav|The priest and deacon paced up and down the room; clouds of blue smoke drifted in the air, and there was a smell of incense.
5543_27761_000004_000007.wav|That was why every movement of Lelechka's bewitched her mother.
5543_27761_000066_000001.wav|"What nonsense!
5543_27761_000013_000001.wav|Lelechka then ran away, stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets, and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed.
5543_27761_000083_000001.wav|She seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her.
5543_27761_000077_000003.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna herself began the game once or twice, though she played it with a heavy heart.
5543_27761_000101_000001.wav|She met her husband.
5543_27761_000113_000001.wav|She went into the nursery and began to walk round the room, looking into those places where Lelechka used to hide herself.
5543_27761_000043_000000.wav|"Well?" said Fedosya, the ludicrous expression of curiosity on her face becoming more emphatic.
5543_27761_000046_000000.wav|"It's the truth I'm saying, remember my words," Agathya went on with the same assurance and secrecy.
5543_27761_000041_000000.wav|This expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden, roughly painted doll.
5543_27761_000051_000000.wav|"Madam, madam," she said quietly, in a trembling voice.
5543_27761_000120_000000.wav|The little one did not reply.
5543_27761_000068_000000.wav|"What nonsense!
5543_27761_000086_000000.wav|She prayed long that night, but the prayer did not relieve her sadness.
5543_27761_000122_000000.wav|Lelechka was being carried out.
5543_27761_000022_000001.wav|A smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips.
5543_27761_000022_000000.wav|Her mother stood, with suppressed breathing, her head pressed against the wall, her hair somewhat disarranged.
5543_27761_000009_000004.wav|Always irreproachable and tactful, Nesletyev got on in his position not so fast that any one should envy him, nor yet so slow that he should envy any one else-everything came in the proper measure and at the proper time.
5543_27761_000023_000000.wav|The nurse, Fedosya, a good-natured and fine looking, if somewhat stupid woman, smiled as she looked at her mistress with her characteristic expression, which seemed to say that it was not for her to object to gentlewomen's caprices.
5543_27761_000023_000001.wav|She thought to herself: "The mother is like a little child herself-look how excited she is."
5543_27761_000033_000000.wav|"I'll think it over," his wife answered, smiling, as he did, coldly but genially.
5543_27761_000106_000000.wav|"Go away," she said quietly.
5543_27761_000058_000000.wav|"Please speak in a sensible way," observed Serafima Aleksandrovna dryly.
5543_27761_000004_000001.wav|Lelechka was a delightful child.
5543_27761_000064_000000.wav|"Who told you all this?" asked Serafima Aleksandrovna in an austere low voice.
5543_27761_000046_000001.wav|"It's the surest sign."
5543_27761_000058_000001.wav|"I understand nothing of what you are saying."
5543_27761_000065_000000.wav|"Agathya says so, madam," answered Fedosya; "it's she that knows."
5543_27761_000106_000001.wav|"Lelechka is playing.
5543_27761_000007_000000.wav|The Nesletyevs, Sergey Modestovich and Serafima Aleksandrovna, had married without love or calculation, because it was the accepted thing.
5543_27761_000039_000000.wav|"That the mistress does it, well, that's one thing; but that the young lady does it, that's bad."
5543_27761_000061_000001.wav|But, somehow, a sense of fear and of sadness crept into her mood, and it was humiliating to feel that an absurd tale should disturb her beloved fancies, and should agitate her so deeply.
5543_27761_000124_000000.wav|Lelechka was quickly carried away from her mother, and those who carried her seemed to run rather than to walk.
5543_27761_000068_000003.wav|She saw clearly that there could be no possible connexion between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life.
5543_27761_000045_000000.wav|"What are you saying?" exclaimed Fedosya, frightened.
5543_27761_000103_000000.wav|Sergey Modestovich looked anxiously at her pale face.
5543_27761_000108_000000.wav|"She'll be up in a minute," persisted Serafima Aleksandrovna, her eyes fixed on the dead little girl.
5543_27761_000011_000000.wav|A little girl was born; Serafima Aleksandrovna gave herself up to her. At the beginning she used to tell her husband, with rapture, of all the joyous details of Lekchka's existence.
5543_27761_000004_000002.wav|There was no other such child, there never had been, and there never would be.
5543_27761_000029_000000.wav|"It's just as I thought...
5543_27761_000006_000000.wav|Perhaps it was because he himself loved the cold-he loved to drink cold water, and to breathe cold air.
5543_27761_000053_000000.wav|"What is it, Fedosya?" she asked with great concern.
5543_27761_000005_000000.wav|To tell the truth, Serafima Aleksandrovna felt happy only in the nursery.
5543_27761_000005_000001.wav|She felt cold with her husband.
5543_27761_000015_000000.wav|"Where is my baby girl?" the mother asked, as she looked for Lelechka and made believe that she did not see her.
5543_27761_000027_000001.wav|He entered the nursery, smiling his genial cold smile; he was irreproachably dressed, and he looked fresh and erect, and he spread round him an atmosphere of cleanliness, freshness and coldness.
5543_27761_000119_000001.wav|When she entered the parlour there were several people between her and Lelechka.
5543_27761_000118_000000.wav|Sergey Modestovich hurried the funeral.
5543_27761_000017_000001.wav|Her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion.
5543_27761_000008_000001.wav|He looked handsome and well bred; his intelligent grey eyes always preserved a dignified expression; and he fulfilled his obligations of a fiance with irreproachable gentleness.
5543_27761_000080_000001.wav|No sooner had she climbed into her little bed, protected by a network on all sides, than her eyes began to close from fatigue.
5543_27761_000037_000000.wav|"And the mistress herself is like a little one," added Fedosya, smiling.
5543_27761_000111_000001.wav|He was confused and annoyed.
5543_27761_000068_000004.wav|She made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters, but her thoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that Lelechka loved to hide herself.
5543_27761_000088_000001.wav|Lelechka caught cold.
5543_27761_000076_000004.wav|Is it not a germ of the unconscious non desire to live?"
5543_27761_000080_000000.wav|Lelechka was about to fall asleep.
5543_27761_000112_000001.wav|She did not oppose him.
5543_27761_000011_000003.wav|She loved her little girl with the ungratified passion that other women, deceived in their husbands, show their chance young lovers.
5543_27761_000009_000000.wav|The bride was also good looking; she was a tall, dark eyed, dark haired girl, somewhat timid but very tactful.
5543_27761_000057_000000.wav|"I can't tell you how bad it is," said Fedosya, and her face expressed the most decided confidence.
5543_27761_000009_000002.wav|He had connexions, and his wife came of good, influential people.
5543_27761_000024_000001.wav|Her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game; her heart beat with short quick strokes, and she pressed even closer to the wall, disarranging her hair still more.
5543_27761_000089_000001.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna tried to console herself with the hope that Lelechka would get well, and would again laugh and play-yet this seemed to her an unthinkable happiness!
5543_27761_000009_000001.wav|He was not after her dowry, though it pleased him to know that she had something.
5543_27761_000067_000000.wav|Fedosya, dejected, her feelings hurt, left her mistress.
5543_27761_000123_000000.wav|Then she put her head out from behind the door, and began to laugh.
5543_27761_000121_000000.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna stood up erect, sighed in a lost way, smiled, and called loudly: "Lelechka!"
5543_27761_000081_000000.wav|The mother's heart seemed to stop-Lelechka lay there so small, so frail, so quiet.
5543_27761_000076_000001.wav|Why does she not get tired of the same thing-of eternally closing her eyes, and of hiding her face?
5543_27761_000040_000000.wav|"Why?" asked Fedosya with curiosity.
5543_27761_000019_000000.wav|Her mother went to hide.
5543_27761_000027_000002.wav|He entered in the midst of the lively game, and he confused them all by his radiant coldness.
5543_27761_000076_000003.wav|If this is so, is it not a sign of organic weakness?
5543_27761_000024_000000.wav|Lelechka was getting nearer her mother's corner.
5543_27761_000034_000000.wav|Then they began to talk of something else.
5543_27761_000004_000005.wav|But it was not these charms in Lelechka that gave her mother the keenest joy.
5543_27761_000004_000006.wav|Lelechka was her mother's only child.
5543_27761_000009_000003.wav|This might, at the proper opportunity, prove useful.
5543_27761_000050_000001.wav|Fedosya had a worried, frightened look.
5543_27761_000110_000001.wav|"This would be a miracle, and miracles do not happen in the nineteenth century."
5543_27761_000106_000002.wav|She'll be up in a minute."
5543_27761_000107_000000.wav|"Sima, my dear, don't agitate yourself," said Sergey Modestovich in a whisper.
5543_27761_000069_000001.wav|Then she would look out with a sly glance.
5543_27761_000105_000000.wav|Lelechka was dressed, placed in a little coffin, and carried into the parlour.
5543_27761_000088_000003.wav|When Serafima Aleksandrovna, awakened by Fedosya, came to Lelechka and saw her looking so hot, so restless, and so tormented, she instantly recalled the evil omen, and a hopeless despair took possession of her from the first moments.
5543_27761_000083_000000.wav|With these words she fell asleep, her face pressing the pillow.
5543_27761_000027_000003.wav|Even Fedosya felt abashed, now for her mistress, now for herself.
5543_27761_000011_000002.wav|Serafima Aleksandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him.
5543_27761_000010_000001.wav|Later, however, when his wife was about to have a child, Sergey Modestovich established connexions elsewhere of a light and temporary nature. Serafima Aleksandrovna found this out, and, to her own astonishment, was not particularly hurt; she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling.
5543_27761_000089_000002.wav|And Lelechka grew feebler from hour to hour.
5543_27761_000017_000000.wav|Lelechka laughed long and merrily, her head close to her mother's knees, and all of her cuddled up between her mother's white hands.
5543_27761_000054_000001.wav|"Lelechka is asleep, may God be with her!
5543_27761_000056_000000.wav|"Why not good?" asked Serafima Aleksandrovna, with vexation, succumbing involuntarily to vague fears.
5543_27761_000032_000001.wav|I don't insist.
5543_27761_000074_000001.wav|She eagerly complied with her mother's new wishes.

4515_11057_000135_000001.wav|It was written with undisturbed kindness of feeling, but in few words.
4515_11057_000136_000003.wav|I have been thinking: couldn't you use your holiday in Sark for a story?
4515_11057_000133_000008.wav|If you can't see me, at least let us write to each other.
4515_13143_000016_000000.wav|--'Twill have no effect, said my father.
4515_13143_000015_000000.wav|I would shew him publickly, said my uncle Toby, at the market cross.

3660_172182_000017_000003.wav|So he received the homage of such as were there.
3660_172182_000017_000005.wav|"It is too soon for you to go away yet," said he; "stay with me until I have finished receiving the homage of my chief men, who have agreed to come to me." And they remained with him until he had done so.
3660_172182_000016_000004.wav|And that day and that night were spent in the utmost enjoyment.
3660_172182_000013_000005.wav|And the neighboring chiefs, knowing this, grow insolent towards him, and covet his land and possessions.
3660_172182_000005_000002.wav|And so they came to the palace.
3660_172182_000008_000005.wav|"will I grant to him, since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself." "Thus will it be best to do," said Arthur; "let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live.
3660_172182_000015_000009.wav|And to do honor to Geraint, all the chief men of the country were invited that night to visit him.
3660_172182_000005_000004.wav|"Right gladly shall it be so," said Arthur.
3660_172182_000015_000001.wav|And the next day the ambassadors were permitted to depart, and they were told that Geraint should follow them.
3660_172182_000016_000003.wav|And they were not long in giving, so eager was every one to bestow gifts, and of those who came to ask gifts, none departed unsatisfied.
3660_172182_000016_000001.wav|And Kadyriath came to them to know what were their requests.
3660_172182_000006_000001.wav|"I know not who they are," said he, "But I know," said Guenever; "this is the knight whom Geraint pursued, and methinks that he comes not here by his own free will.
3660_172182_000003_000001.wav|The men and the dogs were divided into hunting parties, and the dogs were let loose upon the stag.
3660_172182_000012_000006.wav|And Geraint from that time forth loved the hunt, and the tournament, and hard encounters; and he came victorious from them all.
3660_172182_000008_000003.wav|"I am, lord," said he, "and I have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable." Then he told Arthur all his adventure.
3660_172182_000014_000000.wav|"Well," said Arthur, "go and divest yourselves of your accoutrements, and take food, and refresh yourselves after your fatigues; and before you go from hence you shall have an answer." And they went to eat.
3660_172182_000014_000003.wav|And that day and that night were spent in abundance of feasting.
3660_172182_000008_000000.wav|Then Arthur came to them.
3660_172182_000011_000014.wav|And from that time she became his wife.
3660_172182_000007_000001.wav|And Guenever was sorry when she saw the condition he was in, even though he was accompanied by the churlish dwarf.
3660_172182_000015_000000.wav|And that night they went to sleep.
3660_172182_000008_000008.wav|And Arthur caused Morgan Tud to be called to him.
3660_172182_000013_000003.wav|And he greets thee well, as an uncle should greet his nephew, and as a vassal should greet his lord.
3660_172182_000017_000004.wav|And the day after the followers of Arthur intended to go away.
3660_172182_000008_000001.wav|And he saluted Arthur, and Arthur gazed a long time upon him and was amazed to see him thus.
3660_172182_000017_000002.wav|And they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for Geraint to come and receive their homage.
3660_172182_000014_000004.wav|And Arthur told Geraint the cause of the mission, and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of Cornwall.
3660_172182_000005_000005.wav|And Guenever caused a watch to be set upon the ramparts for Geraint's coming.
3660_172182_000008_000012.wav|And the steward of the household so ordered her.
3660_172182_000008_000009.wav|He was the chief physician.
3660_172182_000001_000000.wav|CHAPTER six
3660_172182_000017_000001.wav|Then Geraint sent ambassadors to the men of Cornwall to ask them this.
3660_172182_000006_000004.wav|Miserable and broken is the armor that he wears, and the hue of blood is more conspicuous upon it than its own color." "Knowest thou his name?" said she.
3660_172182_000011_000015.wav|And the next day Arthur satisfied all the claimants upon Geraint with bountiful gifts.
3660_172182_000003_000000.wav|Now this is how Arthur hunted the stag.
3660_172182_000012_000004.wav|And the head of the stag was given to Enid.
3660_172182_000015_000007.wav|And they came to the court.
3660_172182_000014_000001.wav|And Arthur considered that it would go hard with him to let Geraint depart from him, and from his court; neither did he think it fair that his cousin should be restrained from going to protect his dominions and his boundaries, seeing that his father was unable to do so.
3660_172182_000017_000006.wav|Then they set forth towards the court of Arthur.
3660_172182_000007_000009.wav|And thereupon we encountered each other, and he left me, lady, as thou seest." "Sir," said she, "when thinkest thou that Geraint will be here?" "To morrow, lady, I think he will be here with the maiden."
3660_172182_000012_000003.wav|And I do not believe that any will begrudge it her, for between her and every one here there exists nothing but love and friendship." Much applauded was this by them all, and by Arthur also.
3660_172182_000007_000007.wav|"At the place where we were jousting and contending for the sparrow hawk, in the town which is now called Cardiff.
3660_172182_000012_000005.wav|And thereupon her fame increased, and her friends became more in number than before.
3660_172182_000003_000002.wav|And the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of Arthur; Cavall was his name.
3660_172182_000005_000000.wav|Then they all set forth, holding converse together concerning the head of the stag, to whom it should be given.
3660_172182_000007_000006.wav|And Geraint greets thee well; and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf." "Now where did he overtake thee?"
3660_172182_000004_000001.wav|"Lord," said he, "behold, yonder is Guenever, and none with her save only one maiden." "Command Gildas, the son of Caw, and all the scholars of the court," said Arthur, "to attend Guenever to the palace." And they did so.
3660_172182_000015_000006.wav|And there was great rejoicing and gladness throughout the whole court, and through all the country, concerning Geraint, because of the greatness of their love to him, and of the greatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from amongst them, and because he was come to take possession of his dominions, and to preserve his boundaries.
3660_172182_000008_000006.wav|And if he live, he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged best by the men of the court.
3660_172182_000015_000010.wav|And they passed that day and that night in the utmost enjoyment.
3660_172182_000017_000007.wav|And Geraint went to bear them company, and Enid also, as far as Diganwy; there they parted.
3660_172182_000013_000007.wav|And unto him he represents that it were better for him to spend the flower of his youth and the prime of his age in preserving his own boundaries, than in tournaments which are productive of no profit, although he obtains glory in them."
3660_172182_000007_000004.wav|"Lady," said he, "Geraint, the son of Erbin, thy best and most valiant servant, greets thee." "Did he meet with thee?" she asked.
3660_172182_000017_000009.wav|And experienced guides, and the chief men of his country, went with him.
3660_172182_000012_000007.wav|And a year, and a second, and a third, he proceeded thus, until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom.
3660_172182_000011_000005.wav|And Geraint came to where Arthur was, and saluted him. "Heaven protect thee," said Arthur, "and the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.
3660_172182_000006_000003.wav|"Lady," said he, "at the gate there is a knight, and I saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he.
3660_172182_000015_000008.wav|And in the court they had ample entertainment, and a multitude of gifts, and abundance of liquor, and a sufficiency of service, and a variety of games.
3660_172182_000005_000001.wav|One wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him, and another to the lady whom he loved best.
3660_172182_000016_000002.wav|And every one asked that which he desired. And the followers of Arthur began to make gifts, and immediately the men of Cornwall came, and gave also.
3660_172182_000005_000006.wav|And after midday they beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse, and after him a dame or a damsel, also on horseback, and after her a knight of large stature, bowed down, and hanging his head low and sorrowfully, and clad in broken and worthless armor.
3660_172182_000011_000012.wav|And when it was time for them to go to sleep they went.
3660_172182_000006_000002.wav|But Geraint has overtaken him, and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost." And thereupon, behold, a porter came to the spot where Guenever was.
3660_172182_000003_000004.wav|And at the second turn the stag came toward the hunting party of Arthur.
3660_172182_000011_000016.wav|And the maiden took up her abode in the palace, and she had many companions, both men and women, and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of Britain.
3660_172182_000015_000003.wav|Said Geraint, "I think I shall have enough of knighthood with me." And they set forth.
3660_172182_000011_000009.wav|And Arthur gave away the maiden to Geraint.
3660_172182_000013_000001.wav|"Heaven prosper you!" said Arthur; "and whence do you come?"
3660_172182_000012_000001.wav|"Rightly did I judge," said she, "concerning the head of the stag, that it should not be given to any until Geraint's return; and behold, here is a fit occasion for bestowing it.
3660_172182_000007_000005.wav|"Yes," said he, "and it was not to my advantage; and that was not his fault, but mine, lady.

So she told Geraint all that had passed.
3660_172183_000019_000002.wav|Then he rushed upon one of them, and thrust his lance through his body.
3660_172183_000016_000002.wav|"Behold then, chieftain, this is most expedient for thee to do to save me from all reproach; come here to morrow and take me away as though I knew nothing thereof." "I will do so," said he.

3660_172183_000019_000016.wav|"I will not, by Heaven," said she.

3660_172183_000009_000005.wav|And he desired Enid to mount her horse, and to ride forward, and to keep a long way before him.
3660_172183_000019_000004.wav|But the third turned upon him and struck him with his club so that he split his shield and crushed his shoulder.

3660_172183_000002_000000.wav|Geraint, as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur's court, frequented tournaments.
3660_172183_000011_000009.wav|And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep; and there they met a slender stripling with a satchel about his neck, and they saw that there was something in the satchel, but they knew not what it was.
3660_172183_000019_000008.wav|Piercing and loud and thrilling was the cry that Enid uttered.
3660_172183_000019_000023.wav|Then he offered her a goblet of liquor.
3660_172183_000018_000003.wav|Then he went forward into an open glade that was near the road.
3660_172183_000019_000038.wav|When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, "O chieftain, whoever thou art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man?" "O Heaven!" said he, "is it Geraint?" "Yes, in truth," said she; "and who art thou?"
3660_172183_000018_000002.wav|"Stay thou here," said he, "and I will go and see what is the cause of this wailing." "I will," said she.
3660_172183_000011_000010.wav|And he had a small blue pitcher in his hand, and a bowl on the mouth of the pitcher.
3660_172183_000011_000007.wav|Then he arose, and said unto her, "Take the horses and ride on, and keep straight on as thou didst yesterday." And they left the wood, and they came to an open country, with meadows on one hand, and mowers mowing the meadows.

3660_172183_000019_000025.wav|Thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek, and her lamentations were much greater than they had been before; for she considered in her mind, that, had Geraint been alive, he durst not have struck her thus.

4831_29134_000001_000004.wav|The University bill was safe, now; he could leave it without fear; it needed his presence and his watching no longer.
4831_29134_000023_000000.wav|When Senator Dilworthy departed from Cattleville, he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the United States Senate.
4831_29134_000018_000001.wav|Temptations lay all about him, and sometimes he was about to yield, but he would think of some precious lesson he learned in his Sunday School a long time ago, and that would save him.

4831_29134_000013_000007.wav|My soul is lost in wonder at the thought!
4831_29134_000009_000002.wav|Elderly people directed each other's attention and, said, "There! that's him, with the grand, noble forehead!" Boys nudged each other and said, "Hi, Johnny, here he is, there, that's him, with the peeled head!"
4831_29134_000010_000004.wav|After that they began to come to themselves by degrees, and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pulling hair.
4831_29134_000021_000000.wav|"Well, at last, what do you think happened?
4831_29134_000016_000001.wav|They could not give him a costly education; but they were good and wise and they sent him to the Sunday School.

4831_25894_000031_000000.wav|'Mamma says, come to the door; it's too muddy to throw the money into the street!' cried out a kindly child's voice as Tessa held up the old cap, with beseeching eyes.
4831_25894_000011_000004.wav|'Tommo will like to have me go with him and sing, while he plays his harp in the streets.
4831_25894_000032_000001.wav|Tessa felt so grateful that, without waiting for Tommo, she sang her sweetest little song all alone.
4831_25894_000029_000001.wav|Quick! quick!' cried Tommo, twanging away with all his might, and showing his white teeth, as he smiled back at the little gentle folk.
4831_25894_000058_000001.wav|What happy little souls they were that morning; and when they were quiet again, how like a fairy tale did Tessa's story sound to them. Ranza was quite ready to be an angel; and the boys promised to be marvellously good, if they were only allowed to see the tree at the 'palace,' as they called the great house.
4831_25894_000032_000000.wav|Up the wide stone steps went the street musicians, and the whole flock came running down to give a handful of silver, and ask all sorts of questions.
4831_25894_000014_000001.wav|She thanked Tommo, and ran away to get ready, for she felt sure her father would not refuse her anything.
4831_25894_000037_000000.wav|'Oh, so much!' exclaimed Tessa; adding eagerly, 'my sister Ranza is small and pretty as a baby angel.
4831_25894_000044_000000.wav|'I say, mamma; she wants something to eat.
4831_25894_000015_000001.wav|As soon as her father was gone, Tessa flew about and put everything in nice order, telling the children she was going out for the day, and they were to mind Tommo's mother, who would see about the fire and the dinner; for the good woman loved Tessa, and entered into her little plans with all her heart.
4831_25894_000016_000001.wav|It was rather a dirty hand, but so kind that Tessa clung to it, and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement.
4831_25894_000057_000007.wav|In her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures; for Tommo had stuffed it full of queer things, and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape, from fat pigs to full omnibuses.
4831_25894_000050_000003.wav|Alice, get your play hood; this handkerchief is all wet; and, Maud, bring the old chinchilla tippet.'
4831_25894_000059_000002.wav|Mamma and Miss Rose drilled them all; and when the folding doors flew open, one rapturous 'Oh!' arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival.
4831_25894_000050_000002.wav|Freddy, bring me your mittens; these poor hands must be covered.
4831_25894_000057_000003.wav|Four socks, instead of three; and by the fourth, pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress, evidently meant for her-a warm, woollen dress, all made, and actually with bright buttons on it.
4831_25894_000013_000000.wav|'But see, then, it is cold in the streets; the wind bites, and the snow freezes one's fingers.
4831_25894_000012_000000.wav|So full of her plan was Tessa that she ran upstairs at once, and asked Tommo if he would take her with him on the morrow.
4831_25894_000035_000000.wav|'I wish she could sing at our tree, since Bella is ill,' cried one of the children peeping through the banisters.
4831_25894_000041_000001.wav|As the door opened, Tessa saw what looked to her like a fairy feast,--all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine in tall glass pitchers, and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction.
4831_25894_000014_000002.wav|She sewed up the holes in her shoes as well as she could, for she had much of that sort of cobbling to do; she mended her only gown, and laid ready the old hood and shawl which had been her mother's.
4831_25894_000011_000003.wav|I'll do it! if father will let me,' she said to herself, smiling and nodding at the fire.
4831_25894_000023_000002.wav|Tommo's mother lent her a pair of boots so big that they turned up at the toes, but there were no holes in them, and Tessa felt quite elegant in whole boots.
4831_25894_000052_000001.wav|I have no way to say "thank you;" but Ranza shall be for you a heavenly angel, and I will sing my heart out for your tree!' cried Tessa, folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how.
4831_25894_000011_000001.wav|Just as Tessa's tears began to tumble off her eyelashes on to her brown cheeks, the cricket began to chirp.
4831_25894_000043_000000.wav|'Yes, sir,' meekly answered Tessa.
4831_25894_000041_000000.wav|'I'll ask mamma,' said Rose; and away she went into the dining room close by.
4831_25894_000022_000002.wav|But she had made half a dollar, for Tommo divided the money fairly, and she felt rich with her share.
4831_25894_000011_000005.wav|I know many songs, and may get money if I am not frightened; for people throw pennies to other little girls who only play the tambourine.
4831_25894_000059_000003.wav|I assure you, it was splendid; the great tree glittering with lights and gifts; and, on her invisible perch, up among the green boughs, sat the little golden haired angel, all in white, with downy wings, a shining crown on her head, and the most serene satisfaction in her blue eyes, as she stretched her chubby arms to those below, and smiled her baby smile at them.
4831_25894_000008_000000.wav|Tessa's father was an Italian plaster worker, very poor, but kind and honest.
4831_25894_000007_000000.wav|Little Tessa sat alone by the fire, waiting for her father to come home from work.
4831_25894_000044_000001.wav|Can I give her an orange?' called the boy, prancing away into the splendid room, quite like a fairy prince, Tessa thought.
4831_25894_000034_000001.wav|She is dead now; but I do not forget,' answered Tessa, in her pretty broken English.
4831_25894_000008_000002.wav|She tried to be very wise and motherly, and worked for them like any little woman; but it was so hard to keep the small bodies warm and fed, and the small souls good and happy, that poor Tessa was often at her wits' end.
4831_25894_000022_000003.wav|The other days were very much like this; sometimes they made more, sometimes less, but Tommo always 'went halves;' and Tessa kept on, in spite of cold and weariness, for her plans grew as her earnings increased, and now she hoped to get useful things, instead of candy and toys alone.
4831_25894_000050_000001.wav|The lady understood her, and stroked her cheek softly, saying to her elder daughter, 'We must take care of this good little creature.
4831_25894_000021_000000.wav|Tessa walked more quietly, and rubbed her cold hands, feeling that the world was a very big place, and wondering how the children got on at home without the little mother.
4831_25894_000028_000005.wav|All of a sudden a little head appeared at the window, as if the sound had brought it; then another and another, till there were five, of all heights and colors, and five eager faces peeped out, smiling and nodding to the two below.
4831_25894_000028_000004.wav|They were just going to turn away; but they didn't, for that angry thump happened to be the best thing they could have done.
4831_25894_000014_000006.wav|When she had told her plan, peter Benari shook his head, and thought it would never do; but Tessa begged so hard, he consented at last that she should try it for one week, and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in New York.
4831_25894_000015_000000.wav|Next morning the sun shone, but the cold wind blew, and the snow lay thick in the streets.
4831_25894_000018_000001.wav|One fat old Frenchman nodded to her, and it seemed to help her very much; for she began to sing before she thought, and that was the hardest part of it.
4831_25894_000046_000000.wav|'Will you come, too, and bring your harp?
4831_25894_000028_000001.wav|At the fourth, some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing.
4831_25894_000023_000004.wav|How gay the streets were that day! how brisk every one was, and how bright the faces looked, as people trotted about with big baskets, holly wreaths, and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid Christmas trees!
4831_25894_000023_000001.wav|She tied a bright scarlet handkerchief over the old hood, and the brilliant color set off her brown cheeks and bright eyes, as well as the pretty black braids of her hair.
4831_25894_000009_000000.wav|You see, Christmas was coming in a week; and she had set her heart on putting something in the children's stockings, as the mother used to do, for while she lived things were comfortable.
4831_25894_000013_000001.wav|The day is very long, people are cross, and at night one is ready to die with weariness.
4831_25894_000022_000000.wav|All the afternoon the two friends wandered about, singing and playing, and gathering up their small harvest.
4831_25894_000048_000000.wav|'Give these to your brothers,' said the fairy prince, stuffing nuts and oranges into Tessa's hands.
4831_25894_000022_000001.wav|At dusk they went home, Tessa so hoarse she could hardly speak, and so tired she fell asleep over her supper.
4831_25894_000014_000000.wav|'I do not mind cold and wet, and cross people, if I can get the pennies,' answered Tessa, feeling very brave with such a friend to help her.
4831_25894_000059_000006.wav|It was a happy night: and all their lives they remembered it as something too beautiful and bright to be quite true.
4831_25894_000030_000001.wav|How Tessa did tune up at that!
4831_25894_000055_000001.wav|The little mother kept nothing for herself but the pleasure of giving everything away; yet, I think, she was both richer and happier than if she had kept them all.
4831_25894_000008_000006.wav|No; she had a fine plan in her good little head, and was trying to discover how she could carry it out.
4831_25894_000030_000000.wav|Bless us!
4831_25894_000059_000000.wav|Little Ranza was accepted with delight by the kind lady and her children, and Tessa learned the song quite easily.
4831_25894_000057_000002.wav|She got up early, to see if the socks were all right, and there she found the most astonishing sight.
4831_25894_000028_000000.wav|At the first house, a cross old gentleman flapped his newspaper at them; at the second, a young gentleman and lady were so busy talking that they never turned their heads, and at the third, a servant came out and told them to go away, because some one was sick.
4831_25894_000030_000003.wav|The children laughed, and clapped their hands, and cried 'More! more!
4831_25894_000024_000000.wav|'If I could have a tree for the children, I'd never want anything again. But I can't; so I'll fill the socks all full, and be happy,' said Tessa, as she looked wistfully into the gay stores, and saw the heavy baskets go by.
4831_25894_000038_000000.wav|'Sit down and warm yourself, and tell me about Ranza,' said the kind elder sister, who liked the confiding little girl, in spite of her shabby clothes.
4831_25894_000058_000000.wav|Dear me!
4831_25894_000042_000000.wav|'Are you hungry?' asked the boy, in a grand tone.
4831_25894_000028_000002.wav|The next three houses were empty; and the last of all showed not a single face as they looked up anxiously.
4831_25894_000014_000004.wav|She longed to make the beds and dress the children over night, she was in such a hurry to have all in order; but, as that could not be, she sat down again, and tried over all the songs she knew.
4831_25894_000017_000001.wav|They like my music, and often give me sips of hot coffee, which I like much.
4831_25894_000057_000000.wav|Tessa felt very rich as she crept under the faded counterpane, feeling as if she had received a lovely gift, and fell happily asleep with chubby Ranza in her arms, and the two rough black heads peeping out at the foot of the bed.
4831_25894_000008_000001.wav|The mother had died not long ago, and left twelve year old Tessa to take care of the little children.
4831_25894_000010_000003.wav|But what can I do, so small and stupid and shy as I am?
4831_25894_000040_000000.wav|'O Rose! let us see the little girl; and if she will do, let us have her, and Tessa can learn our song, and it will be splendid!' cried the biggest boy, who sat astride of a chair, and stared at the harp with round eyes.
4831_25894_000019_000001.wav|I like this very much; and now it is not hard.'
4831_25894_000057_000001.wav|She dreamed wonderful dreams that night, and woke in the morning to find real wonders before her eyes.
4831_25894_000011_000006.wav|Yes, I will try; and then, if I do well, the little ones shall have a Merry Christmas.'
4831_18525_000018_000000.wav|"It's just this, Tom.
4831_18525_000134_000001.wav|And then to post it.
4831_18525_000016_000001.wav|"Tom, see here!"
4831_18525_000103_000000.wav|"He took it out," said Adela, for the first time finding her tongue.
4831_18525_000121_000000.wav|"I wrote that all myself," hummed Phronsie, smoothing her gown, in great satisfaction, pointing to the opening of the letter.
4831_18525_000038_000000.wav|"One, two," said Polly, counting, "why, I thought I'd written three; well, this one is most finished, Jasper."
4831_18525_000098_000001.wav|"Are you sick, Polly?" she asked, in great concern.
4831_18525_000061_000000.wav|"But Mamsie said when we started I should get my stamps when I needed them," said Polly.
4831_18525_000104_000001.wav|"My mother says," he announced in triumph, "that father will get no end of fun over that if you let it go.
4831_18525_000011_000000.wav|"And you'll go on drawing and painting until you get to be a great artist," ran on Polly, enthusiastically, "and then we'll see something you've done, in the Louvre, maybe."
4831_18525_000019_000000.wav|Tom bobbed his head, not allowing himself to exclaim, "But that will be only a short journey, now, and we must soon say 'good by.'"
4831_18525_000029_000000.wav|"Ever so much like it," said Tom.
4831_18525_000101_000000.wav|"Then I shall be all as well as ever," said Polly, kissing the wet little face.
4831_18525_000093_000000.wav|"O dear me, how could I say anything?" cried Polly, overcome with remorse and patting Phronsie's yellow hair; "but it is so very dreadful.
4831_18525_000094_000000.wav|Tom's mouth trembled.
4831_18525_000110_000002.wav|See, Polly." She was trimming the third strip of paper, for the Round Robin was to be pasted together and rolled up when it was all done.
4831_18525_000118_000000.wav|"Rather not-much obliged," Tom bobbed his thanks.
4831_18525_000060_000001.wav|"I'll give them to you, Polly."
4831_18525_000047_000000.wav|"The very thing!" exclaimed Tom, striking his hand so heavily on the table, that for a minute it looked as if the ink bottle hopped.
4831_18525_000118_000001.wav|"I want to donate something to granddaddy, and I tell you I'm something awful at a letter."
4831_18525_000062_000000.wav|"Yes, she did," said Jasper, uncomfortably.
4831_18525_000096_000000.wav|"I would," said Tom, coolly, running his hands in his pockets.
4831_18525_000057_000000.wav|"O dear, my stamps are all gone," said Polly, peering into the little box in one corner of her writing case.
4831_18525_000073_000001.wav|And Jasper running in, the table was soon surrounded by the makers of the Round Robin, Adela deserting her sketch book and pulling up a chair.
4831_18525_000079_000000.wav|"Of course, you shall, Pet.
4831_18525_000086_000000.wav|"Wait a minute, Phronsie!" exclaimed Polly, in dismay, "I believe we've made a mistake, Jasper, and got the wrong sheet." And Polly turned off with him to examine the rest of the paper.
4831_18525_000078_000001.wav|"I want to write, too, I do," she cried, very much excited.
4831_18525_000024_000000.wav|When the news was circulated, as it was pretty soon, that the party was not to be broken into at all till Paris was a completed story, the jubilation was such as to satisfy even Tom.
4831_18525_000031_000001.wav|"O dear me!" cried Polly, aghast.
4831_18525_000093_000003.wav|O dear me!"
4831_18525_000002_000000.wav|THE ROUND ROBIN
4831_18525_000120_000001.wav|Picture after picture, cut from railroad guide books, illustrated papers, and it seemed to Jasper gathered as if by magic, with cunning little photographs, broke up the letter, and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey.
4831_18525_000042_000000.wav|Polly looked up quickly, her pen dropping from her fingers, and Jasper deserted his fourth letter and stared.
4831_18525_000088_000000.wav|"Well, I'm glad to see that we haven't made any mistake," cried Polly, turning back in relief.
4831_18525_000107_000001.wav|"I wouldn't feel so badly, Polly," he managed to whisper, when Phronsie was absorbed with her work; "he'll like it probably just as father did the gingerbread boy."
4831_18525_000125_000000.wav|"I'm going to write you one now," declared Phronsie.
4831_18525_000055_000000.wav|"But I didn't say 'Round Robin,'" persisted Tom, "wasn't smart enough to think of it."
4831_18525_000126_000000.wav|"Do," cried old mr King, in great satisfaction.
4831_18525_000031_000000.wav|But up came another boy.
4831_18525_000059_000000.wav|"Oh, no, Jasper," cried Polly, after him, "you know Mamsie would not allow me to borrow."
4831_18525_000083_000000.wav|"I want Polly to," said Phronsie, wriggling away from the pen that Polly held out alluringly.
4831_18525_000012_000000.wav|"The Louvre!" cried Adela; "O dear me, Polly Pepper."
4831_18525_000033_000001.wav|And the urchin laughed too, thinking this much better fun to tussle with the tall lad, than to hang around a parcel of girls.
4831_18525_000128_000000.wav|"You don't know my mother," exclaimed Tom, "if you think she won't like that.
4831_18525_000066_000002.wav|"Filched 'em out of the old woman's room," he said.
4831_18525_000119_000000.wav|"All right, seeing you wish it so," said Jasper, with a keen look at him, "and these are beauties and no mistake; we couldn't begin to equal them."
4831_18525_000048_000001.wav|"Well, let's leave our letters to day, Polly, and set to on the Round Robin."
4831_18525_000095_000000.wav|"Oh, Tom Selwyn," gasped Polly, looking up over Phronsie's head, "you don't suppose we'd let that letter go."
4831_18525_000040_000001.wav|Then she thought of what Mamsie had said, and slackened her speed.
4831_18525_000134_000000.wav|And one look at mrs Selwyn's face, as she read that Round Robin, was enough for Polly!
4831_18525_000080_000000.wav|"Now, Phronsie, I think you would better begin, for you are the littlest," and she flapped the long strip down in front of her.
4831_18525_000130_000001.wav|"That's the very reason she understands things like a shot-and knows how to take 'em," he said; "and I tell you, Polly," he declared with a burst of confidence that utterly surprised him, "I'd rather have my mother than any other company I know of; she's awful good fun!"
4831_18525_000124_000001.wav|"So you did," he cried; "now that's fine.
4831_18525_000014_000002.wav|"Any room here, Tom, for mother?" she said.
4831_18525_000120_000000.wav|When the letter was finally unrolled and read to Grandpapa, who strayed into the reading room to see what Phronsie was doing, it certainly was a beauty.
4831_18525_000113_000000.wav|"O dear me!" exclaimed Adela, as her scissors slipped, "now you've joggled the table again!" Then she caught Polly's eye.
4831_18525_000088_000001.wav|"Oh, Phronsie, you haven't begun!"
4831_18525_000030_000003.wav|So Polly and the others breathed freely again.
4831_18525_000045_000000.wav|"We might," said Polly, slowly, "write a letter, all of us.
4831_18525_000109_000001.wav|I'm no good in a letter." And again he rushed from the room.
4831_18525_000036_000002.wav|And Jasper and Polly rushed up to date with their journals, and wrote letters home; and Adela worked up her studies and sketches.
4831_18525_000060_000000.wav|"It isn't borrowing," said Jasper, turning back slowly.
4831_18525_000124_000000.wav|mr King thought so, too, and he beamed at Phronsie.
4831_18525_000073_000000.wav|"Thank your stars you have," said Tom, as gaily.
4831_18525_000074_000000.wav|"And Phronsie must come," said Polly, snipping away to get the paper the right width.
4831_18525_000044_000001.wav|"Oh, if you knew granddaddy!" And he sank into a chair by the table, and played with the heap of picture postal cards that Polly was going to address next.
4831_18525_000098_000000.wav|Phronsie lifted her head where she had burrowed it under Polly's arm. When she saw that Polly's round cheeks were really quite pale, she stopped crying at once.
4831_18525_000031_000002.wav|When number three put in an appearance, she gave up all hope at once.
4831_18525_000075_000000.wav|"That's all right," said Jasper, squinting at it critically, "only-just this edge wants a little bit of trimming, Polly." And he snipped off the offending points.
4831_18525_000074_000001.wav|"O dear me, I can't cut it straight.
4831_18525_000085_000000.wav|To please Polly, being what Phronsie longed for next to pleasing Mamsie, she gave a small sigh and took the pen in unsteady fingers.
4831_18525_000096_000002.wav|He's got lots of fun in him," he added.
4831_18525_000108_000000.wav|"But that was different," groaned Polly.
4831_18525_000076_000000.wav|"I'll fetch Phronsie," cried Tom, springing off.
4831_18525_000025_000001.wav|"Oh, do hurry," he begged, "it's the prettiest sight!"
4831_18525_000028_000000.wav|"Oh! isn't it 'Oats, Peas, Beans, and Barley grow'?" cried Polly, as they watched them intently.
4831_18525_000025_000000.wav|That night in the market place at Martigny, Jasper, who was ahead with his father, ran back to Polly, and the others lingering behind.
4831_18525_000014_000000.wav|Tom Selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter; and now in his seat across the narrow aisle, he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor.
4831_18525_000125_000001.wav|Since Grandpapa wanted anything, it was never too soon to begin work on it.
4831_18525_000010_000000.wav|"Yes, I do," said Adela, "and I've got some sketches to take back, and Mademoiselle will be glad of that."
4831_18525_000027_000000.wav|There, in the centre of the market place, was a ring of little girls, hand in hand, singing a little French song, and going round and round in a circle.
4831_18525_000089_000000.wav|She spoke so sharply that Phronsie started, and a little drop of ink trembling on the point of her pen concluded to hop off.
4831_18525_000066_000000.wav|"I know!" ejaculated Tom, whirling on his heel, and dashing out.
4831_18525_000132_000000.wav|"Never you fear," cried Tom, seizing the Round Robin; and waving it over his head, it trailed off back of him like a very long and broad ribbon.
4831_18525_000037_000001.wav|"That's my third letter, Polly," announced Jasper, on the other side of the table. "Now, I am going to begin on Joel's."
4831_18525_000077_000000.wav|"And hurry," cried Polly and Jasper, together, after him.
4831_18525_000067_000000.wav|"Oh, Tom!" began Polly.
4831_18525_000133_000000.wav|"Take care!" cried Jasper, as he ran after with Polly and Adela, "if you dare to tear that, sir!" while Phronsie at the big table laboured away on her letter, Grandpapa sitting by to watch the proceedings, with the greatest interest.
4831_18525_000107_000000.wav|"Polly, you always do think of the best things!" exclaimed Jasper, beaming at her, which made her try harder than ever to smile.
4831_18525_000029_000001.wav|"See those boys; now they are going to make trouble."
4831_18525_000116_000002.wav|And then it struck me I'd make a book like yours."
4831_18525_000113_000001.wav|"Aren't those pictures pretty?" she burst out awkwardly.
4831_18525_000030_000002.wav|But the ring of girls paid no more attention to him, than they had to any other outside matters, being wholly absorbed in the game.
4831_18525_000090_000000.wav|"Oh, see what she's written!" cried Polly, quite aghast, and tumbling into her chair, she pointed at the top.
4831_18525_000081_000000.wav|"Oh, Polly, you begin," begged Tom.
4831_18525_000093_000001.wav|O dear me!
4831_18525_000127_000001.wav|"O dear me!" she exclaimed again, and turned quite pale.
4831_18525_000100_000000.wav|"I won't cry any more," declared Phronsie, wiping off the last tear trailing down her nose.
4831_18525_000129_000000.wav|"But she's so nice," breathed Polly, who greatly admired mrs Selwyn, "and so elegant."
4831_18525_000087_000000.wav|Phronsie, who hadn't heard what Polly said, her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter, and considering, since it was to be done, it was best to have it over with as soon as possible, fell to scribbling the letters as fast as she could, all of them running down hill.
4831_18525_000130_000000.wav|Tom bobbed his head and accepted this as a matter of course.
4831_18525_000044_000000.wav|"Dare!" said Tom, delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words, that after they were out, had scared him mightily.
4831_18525_000017_000000.wav|"What's up, little mother?" asked Tom, in surprise, at her unusual manner.
4831_18525_000093_000002.wav|Phronsie, there, there, don't cry.
4831_18525_000074_000002.wav|Do you please finish it, Jasper."
4831_18525_000097_000001.wav|Just look at her face."
4831_18525_000034_000001.wav|"Isn't it nice to think they do?"
4831_18525_000071_000000.wav|"It's dreadfully thin paper," said Adela, critically, getting off from the sofa to pick at one corner of the sheet Polly was beginning to divide.
4831_18525_000058_000000.wav|"I've plenty," said Jasper, hurrying off; "I'll stick on two for you."
4831_18525_000062_000003.wav|And she gave the bag a little pat for Joel's sake, wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch.
4831_18525_000110_000001.wav|And he made me cut clear into that edge.
4831_18525_000084_000000.wav|"But Polly wants you to," said Jasper.
4831_18525_000112_000000.wav|In came Tom with a rush, and turned a small box he held in his hand upside down on the table.
4831_18525_000008_000000.wav|"Well, I'm sorry the summer is going," said Adela, "because then I've got to leave you at Paris, and go into school."
4831_18525_000122_000000.wav|"O dear me!" exclaimed Polly, softly, for she couldn't even yet get over that dreadful beginning.
4831_18525_000001_000000.wav|twenty four
4831_18525_000005_000000.wav|"Dresden!" echoed Polly, sitting quite straight with very red cheeks;--"oh, Jasper!"
4831_18525_000115_000000.wav|"I don't see how you got so many," said Jasper, in admiration, his fingers busy with the heap.
4831_18525_000094_000001.wav|"It's all right.
4831_18525_000084_000001.wav|"I really would, Phronsie dear, to please her."
4831_18525_000056_000000.wav|"And let's get to work," cried Jasper, huddling up his three letters. "I'll post yours, too, Polly; give them here."
4831_18525_000016_000000.wav|"Now, this is comfy," observed mrs Selwyn, as the train sped on.
4831_18525_000082_000000.wav|"No, I think Phronsie ought to," said Polly, shaking her head.
4831_18525_000043_000000.wav|"Why," said Polly, finding her tongue, "we wouldn't dare, Tom Selwyn."
4831_18525_000132_000001.wav|"Come on, now, all fall into line!"
4831_18525_000032_000001.wav|Hear them jeer!" And his long arm went out and picked a jacket end of an urchin, who, incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding, had hovered too near, while trying to tease the girls.
4831_18525_000061_000001.wav|"You know she did, Jasper."
4831_18525_000046_000000.wav|"So we could," cried Jasper; "how would that do, Tom?"
4831_18525_000003_000000.wav|"Dear me, how the summer is going!" mourned Polly, as they caught on the return journey the last glimpse of the roaring, tumbling Visp, and not all the craning of the necks could compass another view, as the cars drew them away from the rushing river.
4831_18525_000022_000000.wav|"Then you can overcome your dislike to Paris enough to go there?" asked his mother, with a little twinkle in her eye.
4831_18525_000124_000002.wav|I wish you'd write me a letter sometime."
4831_18525_000049_000000.wav|"All right," said Polly, glad to think there was anything she could really do to please the little old earl, "but would your mother like it, Tom?" She stopped slowly in putting her unfinished letter into the little writing case, and looked at him.
4831_18525_000128_000001.wav|She's got lots of fun in her, and she always sees the sense of a thing."
4831_18525_000062_000001.wav|Then his face brightened, and he said, "And she's right, Polly," while Polly fished a franc out of Joel's little money bag that hung at her belt.
4831_18525_000032_000000.wav|"They're jealous chaps," cried Tom, "and are vexed because they can't get into the game!
4831_18525_000131_000000.wav|"I know it," said Polly, brightly, with a little answering smile. "Well, I hope she'll like it."
4831_18525_000104_000002.wav|It will cheer him up."
4831_18525_000110_000000.wav|"That's three times that boy has gone out," announced Adela, "and he joggles the table awfully when he starts.
4831_18525_000072_000000.wav|"I'm glad we have any," hummed Polly, happily.
4831_18525_000127_000000.wav|At that Polly began to have little "creeps" as she always called the shivers.
3663_172005_000020_000001.wav|But at the moment she heard a sound that chilled her heart.
3663_172005_000017_000001.wav|She was going due east, when she turned away toward the north, and kept on at a good pace.
3663_172005_000025_000001.wav|But when the doe had got into the timber, she heard the savage brutes howling across the meadow. (It is well enough, perhaps, to say that nobody offered to shoot the dogs.)
3663_172005_000026_000000.wav|The courage of the panting fugitive was not gone, but the fearful pace at which she had been going told on her.
3663_172005_000022_000003.wav|From the valley ahead came the cry of a searching hound.
3663_172005_000006_000000.wav|If the mother stepped a pace or two farther away in feeding, the fawn made a half movement, as if to rise and follow her.
3663_172005_000015_000005.wav|Flight with the fawn was impossible.
3663_172005_000021_000006.wav|She hesitated; it was only for an instant.
3663_172005_000026_000001.wav|Her legs trembled, and her heart beat like a trip hammer.
3663_172005_000029_000001.wav|She turned to the shore whence she came; the dogs were lapping the water and howling there.
3663_172005_000008_000003.wav|With an affectionate glance at her fawn, she continued picking up her breakfast.
3663_172005_000020_000002.wav|It was the cry of a hound to the west of her.
3663_172005_000011_000001.wav|But there was the fawn.
3663_172005_000021_000003.wav|A mile or two down lay the valley and the farmhouses.
3663_172005_000012_000000.wav|The cry of the hound was repeated, more distinct this time.
3663_172005_000004_000000.wav|The buck, his father, had been that night on a long tramp across the mountain to Clear Pond, and had not yet returned.
3663_172005_000022_000000.wav|She must cross the Slide Brook valley, if possible, and gain the mountain opposite.
3663_172005_000008_000002.wav|There was silence all about in the forest.
3663_172005_000015_000004.wav|The fawn, scrambling after her, tumbled over, and bleated piteously.
3663_172005_000020_000000.wav|After running at high speed perhaps half a mile farther, it occurred to her that it would be safe now to turn to the west, and, by a wide circuit, seek her fawn.
3663_172005_000028_000002.wav|One was rowing; the other had a gun in his hand.
3663_172005_000021_000002.wav|Below her, down the mountain slope, were other clearings broken by patches of woods.
3663_172005_000020_000003.wav|There was nothing to do but to keep on, and on she went, with the noise of the pack behind her.
3663_172005_000028_000000.wav|At her first step into the water she saw a sight that sent her back with a bound.
3663_172005_000013_000001.wav|The doe bounded in advance and waited.
3663_172005_000013_000002.wav|The fawn scrambled after her, slipping and tumbling along, and whining a good deal because his mother kept always moving away from him.
3663_172005_000005_000000.wav|The doe was daintily cropping tender leaves and turning from time to time to regard her offspring.
3663_172005_000019_000002.wav|The baying of the hounds grew fainter behind.
3663_172005_000015_000003.wav|She turned again for flight.
3663_172005_000021_000005.wav|Not a merciful heart in all that lovely valley.
3663_172005_000010_000001.wav|It was repeated.
3663_172005_000028_000003.wav|What should she do?
3663_172005_000024_000000.wav|In a moment more she leaped into the travelled road.
3663_172005_000011_000000.wav|Time enough to fly; time enough to put miles between her and the hound before he should come upon her fresh trail; yes, time enough.
3663_172005_000028_000001.wav|There was a boat mid lake; two men were in it.
3663_172005_000023_000004.wav|The cruel sound gave wings to the poor thing.
3663_172005_000027_000002.wav|Had she strength to swim it?
3663_172005_000008_000000.wav|The doe lifted her head with a quick motion.
3663_172005_000004_000001.wav|He went to feed on the lily pads there.
3663_172005_000021_000000.wav|In five minutes more she had passed into a hillside clearing.
3663_172005_000016_000001.wav|The fawn lay down contentedly, and the doe licked him for a moment.
3663_172005_000012_000001.wav|The mother bounded away a few paces.
3663_172005_000025_000000.wav|By this time the dogs, panting and lolling out their tongues, came swinging along, keeping the trail, like stupids, and consequently losing ground when the deer doubled.
3663_172005_000027_000001.wav|If she could put that piece of water between her and her pursuers, she would be safe.
3663_172005_000009_000000.wav|But suddenly she started, head erect, eyes dilated, a tremor in her limbs.
3663_172005_000026_000005.wav|She used the little respite to push on until the baying was faint in her ears.
3663_172005_000018_000000.wav|In five minutes more she heard the sharp yelp of discovery, and then the deep mouthed howl of pursuit.
3663_172005_000014_000001.wav|He wanted more breakfast, for one thing; and his mother wouldn't stand still.
3663_172005_000029_000003.wav|The brave, pretty creature was quite exhausted now.
3663_172005_000023_000001.wav|The dogs were not in sight, but she could hear them coming down the hill.
3663_172005_000029_000000.wav|The doe saw the boat nearing her.
3663_172005_000023_000002.wav|There was no time for hesitation.
3663_172005_000015_000002.wav|She could not crawl on in this way; the dogs would soon be upon them.
3663_172005_000028_000004.wav|With only a moment's hesitation she plunged into the lake.
3663_172005_000017_000000.wav|She descended the slope of the mountain until she reached the more open forest of hard wood.
3663_172005_000022_000001.wav|She bounded on; she stopped.
3663_172005_000021_000001.wav|She heard a tinkle of bells.
3663_172005_000023_000000.wav|As she approached Slide Brook, she saw a boy standing by a tree with a raised rifle.
3663_172005_000029_000002.wav|She turned again to the centre of the lake.
3663_172005_000010_000000.wav|There was a sound, a distinct, prolonged note, pervading the woods.
3663_172005_000027_000000.wav|Late in the afternoon she staggered down the shoulder of Bartlett, and stood upon the shore of the lake.
3663_172005_000009_000001.wav|She turned her head to the south; she listened intently.

3663_172005_000021_000004.wav|That way also her enemies were.
3663_172005_000010_000002.wav|The doe had no doubt now.
3663_172005_000026_000003.wav|The dogs were gaining again, and she crossed the broad, deep brook.
3663_172005_000015_000001.wav|The danger was certain now; it was near.
3663_172005_000007_000000.wav|It was a pretty picture,--maternal love on the one part, and happy trust on the other.
3663_172005_000014_000000.wav|Whenever the fawn caught up, he was quite content to frisk about.
3663_172005_000016_000003.wav|She went in the direction of the hounds.
3663_172005_000026_000004.wav|The fording of the river threw the hounds off for a time.
3663_172005_000016_000000.wav|The doe returned, stood by him, head erect and nostrils distended. Perhaps she was thinking.
3663_172528_000023_000005.wav|The Duke gazed at me, and marvelled I was still alive; afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health.
3663_172528_000010_000005.wav|This maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance, and in her fear of being detected, she would have been very glad if I had died.
3663_172528_000011_000004.wav|If you knew that his recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water, why did you not say so before?
3663_172528_000026_000003.wav|You have never made anything so exquisite, which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend; and yet the Pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours. That was the Father and the Son; now beware of the Holy Ghost.  It was firmly believed that Duke Alessandro was the son of Pope Clement.
3663_172528_000009_000000.wav|MY sickness had been of such a very serious nature that it seemed impossible for me to fling it off.
3663_172528_000016_000003.wav|I made the quarrel up, and afterwards got Giorgio into Cardinal de  Medici  s household, and continually helped him.
3663_172528_000029_000004.wav|I never used to shoot with more than one ball, and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits, which cannot be done by other ways of loading.
3663_172528_000024_000002.wav|He repeated:   Get hence as quickly as you can, and be of good courage, for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect.  I the best attention to my health, gave Pietro Pagolo advice about stamping the coins, and then went off upon my way to Rome without saying a word to the Duke or anybody else.
3663_172528_000029_000001.wav|It was close upon nightfall, and during the day I had shot a good number of ducks and geese; then, as I had almost made my mind up to shoot no more that time, we were returning briskly toward Rome.
3663_172528_000028_000003.wav|This being so, as he was a fellow of much humour, we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained.
3663_172528_000012_000001.wav|Cardinal Cornaro, when he heard of my improvement, had me transported to a place of his on Monte Cavallo.
3663_172528_000015_000001.wav|So I made my mind up, and prepared to travel.
3663_172528_000009_000002.wav|Yet all these endeavours were apparently insufficient to overcome the obstinacy of my malady, so that the physicians were in despair and at their wits  ends what to do.
3663_172528_000029_000003.wav|I therefore dismounted at once, got my fowling piece ready, and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball.
3663_172528_000024_000001.wav|He then said,   Beware,  and added:   What displeasure have you given to that rascal Ottaviano de  Medici?  I answered that I had done nothing to displease him, but that he had injured me; and told him all the affair about the Mint.
3663_172528_000029_000005.wav|Of the two geese, one was almost dead, and the other, though badly wounded, was flying lamely.
3663_172528_000015_000006.wav|Did you not know what you have done to displease the Duke?
3663_172528_000027_000000.wav|I now sent to Florence to request Lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal.
3663_172528_000009_000003.wav|I was tormented by thirst, but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctors  orders.
3663_172528_000015_000000.wav|WHEN eight days had come and gone, my amendment was so slight that life itself became almost a burden to me; indeed I had been more than fifty days in that great suffering.
3663_172528_000023_000001.wav|He denied that it was so, and that he had ever said anything of the sort.
3663_172528_000012_000006.wav|You see his malady has been so grave, that if we had brought him the extreme unction, we might not have been in time.
3663_172528_000012_000005.wav|Do not permit him any irregularities; for though he has escaped this time, another disorder now would be the death of him.
3663_172528_000028_000002.wav|This man had no skill in my art; but since we were perpetually day and night together, everybody thought he was a first rate craftsman.
3663_172528_000023_000004.wav|I told him that I had come therein that way solely in order to clear my character.
3663_172528_000010_000006.wav|Accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as I could of the water, so that in good earnest I swallowed more than a flask full.
3663_172528_000016_000004.wav|For these deserts, then, he told Duke Alessandro that I had abused his Excellency, and had bragged I meant to be the first to leap upon the walls of Florence with his foes the exiles.
3663_172528_000029_000007.wav|Trusting to my boots, which came high up the leg, I put one foot forward; it sank in the oozy ground; and so, although I got the goose, the boot of my right leg was full of water.
3663_172528_000009_000005.wav|That old man ceased to give so much annoyance, yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams.
3663_172528_000029_000000.wav|We often held such conversations; but I remember one in particular on the day of Epiphany, when we were together near La Magliana.
3663_172528_000012_000004.wav|They kept and showed it to the doctor, who said he had never seen anything of the sort before, and afterwards remarked to Felice:   Now take care of your Benvenuto, for he is cured.
3663_172528_000023_000003.wav|Then, after a short while, the Duke came by; whereupon I had myself raised up before his Excellency, and he halted.
3663_172528_000029_000008.wav|I lifted my foot and let the water run out; then, when I had mounted, we made haste for Rome.
3663_172528_000016_000008.wav|He had been brought by my very dear friend Luca Martini, who passed the larger portion of the day with me.
3663_172528_000029_000010.wav|I meanwhile was waiting, and put my hands among the breast feathers of the geese, and felt them very warm.
3663_172528_000012_000002.wav|The very evening I was taken with great precautions in a chair, well wrapped up and protected from the cold.
3663_172528_000010_000013.wav|This woke me up, and I called out:   Leave her alone; perhaps, when she meant to do me harm, she did me more good than you were able to do with all your efforts.
3663_172528_000009_000001.wav|That worthy man Maestro Francesco da Norcia redoubled his efforts, and brought me every day fresh remedies, trying to restore strength to my miserable unstrung frame.
3663_172528_000015_000003.wav|That day many friends came to see me; among others Pier Landi, who was the best and dearest friend I ever had.
3663_172528_000015_000005.wav|Now he had heard the Duke say:   Benvenuto would have done much better to die, because he is come to put his head into a noose, and I will never pardon him.  Accordingly when Niccolò arrived, he said to me in desperation:   Alas! my dear Benvenuto, what have you come to do here?
3663_172528_000028_000000.wav|I composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate, and pressed the work forward to my best ability.
3663_172528_000012_000000.wav|Maestro Francesco then gave orders that I should be removed from my room and carried to one of the hills there are in Rome.
3663_172528_000026_000005.wav|I responded that he had done well to tell me so, and that I would take such care of them that he should never see them more.

4323_13259_000009_000000.wav|For Raymond had awakened that morning to the fact that the city had gone for license after all.
4323_13259_000015_000003.wav|I am sure that whatever you and Miss Page think best, will be right."
4323_13259_000022_000002.wav|Henry Maxwell, pastor of the First Church of Raymond.
4323_13259_000009_000003.wav|But the result was the same as if it had been overwhelming.
4323_13259_000009_000012.wav|And this woman who had been brutally struck down by the very hand that had assisted so eagerly to work her earthly ruin what of her?
4323_13259_000022_000004.wav|Raymond, of course, being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region, is full of saloons.
4323_13259_000022_000005.wav|I caught from the minister's remarks that he had only recently changed his views in regard to license.
4323_13259_000008_000001.wav|Only this was with a different attitude.
4323_13259_000011_000002.wav|What had become of its regular, precise, conventional order of service, undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement?
4323_13259_000016_000005.wav|Do you think so, Miss Virginia?"
4323_13259_000023_000007.wav|I cannot describe the effect of that singing.
4323_13259_000013_000009.wav|For her acquaintance was large and many of the recent converts were among her friends.
4323_13259_000009_000001.wav|The rumor at the Rectangle that the second and third wards had gone no license proved to be false.
4323_13259_000021_000000.wav|"In the first place, a most exquisite anthem was sung by a trained choir.
4323_13259_000018_000000.wav|So the arrangements were made, with some difficulty, for the service at the tent; and Virginia with her uncle and Rollin, accompanied by Maxwell, Rachel and President Marsh, and the quartet from the First Church, went down and witnessed one of the strange things of their lives.
4323_13259_000017_000003.wav|We certainly cannot and will not use the occasion for vulgar display.
4323_13259_000007_000001.wav|The church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious, inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on, talking of the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city.
4323_13259_000023_000008.wav|Not a man sang a note.

4323_13259_000021_000006.wav|She will probably be heard from soon.
4323_13259_000011_000004.wav|They had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life.
4323_13259_000010_000001.wav|And men and women wept as he spoke.
4323_13259_000013_000008.wav|Gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what Loreen's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her.
4323_13259_000022_000006.wav|He certainly made a very striking address, and yet it was in no sense inappropriate for a funeral.
4323_13259_000009_000009.wav|The saloon ruled.
4323_13259_000017_000001.wav|"Poor soul!
4323_13259_000009_000008.wav|For that had been the fact in Raymond for years.
4323_13259_000012_000004.wav|Today, the entire force of the gathering seemed to be directed to this one large purpose.
4323_13259_000017_000002.wav|I do not know but that some time I shall know she gave her life for mine.
4323_13259_000020_000003.wav|It seems she had been recently converted during the evangelist's meetings, and was killed while returning from one of the meetings in company with other converts and some of her friends.
4323_13259_000013_000006.wav|What did Miss Page intend to do?
4323_13259_000021_000005.wav|I understand Miss Winslow sings in the First Church of Raymond and could probably command almost any salary as a public singer.
4323_13259_000022_000001.wav|The evangelist, a man of apparently very simple, unassuming style, spoke a few words, and he was followed by a fine looking man, the Rev.
4323_13259_000008_000002.wav|And all through his impassioned appeal this morning, there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger.
4323_13259_000022_000000.wav|"The service aside from the singing was peculiar.
4323_13259_000010_000004.wav|The thought that the Christian conscience had been aroused too late or too feebly, lay with a weight of accusation upon the heart of the editor.
4323_13259_000023_000003.wav|All the time the singing continued softly like rain on a tent cover when the wind is gentle.
4323_13259_000009_000010.wav|No one denied that.
4323_13259_000012_000002.wav|The meeting was tender; it glowed with the Spirit's presence; it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whiskey power in Raymond that would break its reign forever.
4323_13259_000015_000000.wav|"I am and always have been opposed to large public funerals," said Gray, whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its great sources of strength; "but the cry of the poor creatures who knew Loreen is so earnest that I do not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honor.
4323_13259_000014_000001.wav|Gray had gone up to Virginia's and, after talking it over with her and Maxwell, the arrangement had been made.
4323_13259_000010_000005.wav|What if he had begun to do as Jesus would have done, long ago?
4323_13259_000009_000011.wav|What would Jesus do?
4323_13259_000016_000003.wav|The people at the Rectangle will not come here to service.
4323_13259_000010_000000.wav|All this, with a voice that rang and trembled and broke in sobs of anguish for the result, did Henry Maxwell pour out upon his people that Sunday morning.
4323_13259_000021_000003.wav|She had a most wonderful manner in singing, and everybody was weeping before she had sung a dozen words.
4323_13259_000016_000001.wav|"Under the circumstances I have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times.
4323_13259_000009_000007.wav|If all the church members of Raymond had voted against the saloon, it would today be outlawed instead of crowned king of the municipality.
4323_13259_000017_000004.wav|Let her friends be allowed the gratification of their wishes.
4323_13259_000010_000006.wav|Who could tell what might have been accomplished by this time!
4323_13259_000020_000004.wav|She was a common street drunkard, and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any I ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen.
4323_13259_000010_000003.wav|No man had given or suffered more to influence public opinion that week than Norman.
4323_13259_000017_000000.wav|"Yes," said Virginia.
4323_13259_000015_000002.wav|I will be guided by your judgment in the matter.
4323_13259_000021_000007.wav|Such a voice could win its way anywhere.
4323_13259_000021_000002.wav|But the most remarkable part of the music was a solo sung by a strikingly beautiful young woman, a Miss Winslow who, if I remember right, is the young singer who was sought for by Crandall the manager of National Opera, and who for some reason refused to accept his offer to go on the stage.
4323_13259_000023_000004.wav|It was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights I ever witnessed.
4323_13259_000013_000000.wav|But if the First Church was deeply stirred by the events of the last week, the Rectangle also felt moved strangely in its own way.
4323_13259_000009_000004.wav|Raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon.
4323_13259_000008_000000.wav|At the First Church, mr Maxwell, bearing on his face marks of the scene he had been through, confronted an immense congregation, and spoke to it with a passion and a power that came so naturally out of the profound experiences of the day before that his people felt for him something of the old feeling of pride they once had in his dramatic delivery.
4323_13259_000009_000002.wav|It was true that the victory was won by a very meager majority.
4323_13259_000013_000007.wav|The Rectangle had never before mingled even in this distant personal manner with the aristocracy on the boulevard. The opportunities for doing so were not frequent.
4323_13259_000023_000002.wav|Then they sat down and another row filed past, leaving their flowers.
4323_13259_000009_000005.wav|The Christians of Raymond stood condemned by the result.
4323_13259_000009_000006.wav|More than a hundred professing Christian disciples had failed to go to the polls, and many more than that number had voted with the whiskey men.
4323_13259_000011_000001.wav|When had the First Church yielded to such a baptism of tears?
4323_13259_000021_000004.wav|That, of course, is not so strange an effect to be produced at a funeral service, but the voice itself was one of thousands.
4323_13259_000013_000005.wav|Would it be public?
4323_13259_000013_000004.wav|The Rectangle was excited to know the details of the funeral.
4323_13259_000012_000001.wav|But when the congregation had finally gone, and he had entered the lecture room, it needed but a glance to show him that the original company of followers had been largely increased.
4323_13259_000012_000006.wav|And all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse.
4323_13259_000007_000000.wav|THE body of Loreen lay in state at the Page mansion on the avenue. It was Sunday morning and the clear sweet spring air, just beginning to breathe over the city the perfume of early blossoms in the woods and fields, swept over the casket from one of the open windows at the end of the grand hall.
4323_13259_000012_000000.wav|mr Maxwell did not ask, this morning, for volunteers to join those who had already pledged to do as Jesus would.
4323_13259_000023_000001.wav|The women in the tent, at least a large part of them up near the coffin, began to sing in a soft, tearful way, 'I was a wandering sheep.' Then while the singing was going on, one row of women stood up and walked slowly past the casket, and as they went by, each one placed a flower of some kind upon it.
4323_13259_000023_000000.wav|"Then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service.
4323_13259_000020_000002.wav|The occasion was caused by the killing of a woman during an election riot last Saturday night.
4323_13259_000016_000004.wav|I think the most Christian thing will be to let them have the service at the tent.
4323_13259_000012_000003.wav|Since the first Sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as Jesus would do, the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions.
4323_13259_000020_000000.wav|"There was a very unique and unusual funeral service held here this afternoon at the tent of an evangelist, Rev.
4323_13259_000015_000001.wav|What do you think, mr Maxwell?
4323_13259_000013_000003.wav|Every one in the Rectangle knew that Loreen was at this moment lying in the Page mansion up on the avenue. Exaggerated reports of the magnificence of the casket had already furnished material for eager gossip.
4323_13259_000012_000005.wav|It was a meeting full of broken prayers of contrition, of confession, of strong yearning for a new and better city life.
4323_13259_000011_000000.wav|Over the church, in the silence that followed this strange scene, sobs and the noise of weeping arose.
4323_13259_000014_000000.wav|So that is how it happened that Monday afternoon, at the tent, the funeral service of Loreen was held before an immense audience that choked the tent and overflowed beyond all previous bounds.
4323_13259_000016_000000.wav|"I feel as you do," replied mr Maxwell.
4323_13259_000019_000003.wav|A fragment of his account belongs to this part of the history of Raymond:
4323_13259_000016_000002.wav|But this seems different.
4323_18416_000053_000001.wav|Don't, Grandpapa, don't!" she caught him around the neck imploringly.
4323_18416_000067_000002.wav|Can I help in any way?"
4323_18416_000009_000000.wav|"Come down to dinner, Charlotte," said Polly quickly.
4323_18416_000078_000000.wav|"What do you take me for?" demanded Pickering, starting to his feet with flashing eyes, and throwing open his top coat as if the weight oppressed him.
4323_18416_000077_000000.wav|"For Heaven's sake, Pickering!" cried his uncle, darting in front of the chair and its restless occupant, "don't say that again.
4323_18416_000077_000002.wav|What have you been doing lately? Do you gamble?"
4323_18416_000059_000000.wav|"Oh, Grandpapa!" exclaimed Phronsie, breaking away from him to look into his face.
4323_18416_000032_000000.wav|"Grandpapa," said Phronsie, "wasn't mrs Chatterton aunt to Charlotte?"
4323_18416_000013_000000.wav|"Yes, indeed," said Polly cheerily, "just as fine as can be.
4323_18416_000015_000001.wav|I want to consult you in regard to asking Miss Chatterton to sing at my next 'At Home.' I should be charmed to have her favor us.
4323_18416_000036_000001.wav|Don't you suppose so, Grandpapa?" and one hand stole up to his neck.
4323_18416_000074_000000.wav|"Which is a wonder," interpolated Pickering.
4323_18416_000048_000002.wav|"I didn't mean you'd really blame me, only"--
4323_18416_000038_000000.wav|"Wouldn't it make her very glad if I gave Charlotte some of the money?" Phronsie's red lips were very close to his ear now, "oh, I do want to so much; you can't think, Grandpapa, how much!"
4323_18416_000029_000001.wav|"Why, what makes you ask such a question?
4323_18416_000064_000000.wav|"Can't stop, Uncle," said Pickering hastily.
4323_18416_000065_000000.wav|"Indeed you are not, Pickering," cried mr Cabot quickly, the color rising to his cheek.
4323_18416_000009_000001.wav|"Really you must, else I am afraid Grandpapa will be up here after you."
4323_18416_000078_000001.wav|"I've been a lazy dog all my life, and a good for naught; but I hope I've not sunk to that."
4323_18416_000065_000002.wav|But come in, come in." He laid hold of Pickering's arm and gently forced him into the little room.
4323_18416_000065_000001.wav|"There, there, my sister's boy shall never say that.
4323_18416_000073_000000.wav|"I don't see, Pickering," he resumed, "why you shouldn't get along. You're through college."
4323_18416_000060_000001.wav|"But, well, now, Phronsie, you run back to your play, child, and I'll set to work at once to think out this matter."
4323_18416_000071_000001.wav|Not worth it, either," he added, relapsing into his gloom. Then he shoved his chair so that he could not look his uncle in the face, and bent a steady glance out of the window.
4323_18416_000033_000002.wav|What have you got into your head, Phronsie?"
4323_18416_000069_000000.wav|"I've seen this thing, whatever it is, coming upon you for sometime," said mr Cabot, too nervous to notice the entreaty in Pickering's voice and manner, "and I cannot wait any longer to find out the trouble.
4323_18416_000066_000000.wav|Not to be ungracious, the young man threw himself into a chair.
4323_18416_000011_000000.wav|"Indeed, but you must come down," said Polly firmly, holding out her hand.
4323_18416_000017_000000.wav|"The very thing!" exclaimed Jasper, with only a thought for Polly's pleasure, when Polly had cried, "How nice of mrs Cabot!" "Don't you say so, father?" he added.
4323_18416_000030_000000.wav|"Grandpapa," asked Phronsie, looking intently at him, "isn't Charlotte very, very poor?"
4323_18416_000066_000001.wav|"Well, what is it, Uncle?
4323_18416_000043_000000.wav|"Right?" cried Phronsie, opening her brown eyes very wide.
4323_18416_000050_000000.wav|"I know, child; you think your old Grandpapa does just about right," said mr King soothingly, and highly gratified.
4323_18416_000000_000000.wav|"I do believe something is in the room with Charlotte," she said, as Polly came running up the stairs.
4323_18416_000043_000001.wav|"Why, isn't the money my very own, Grandpapa?"
4323_18416_000015_000000.wav|"Do, dear Polly, run over to morrow morning early.
4323_18416_000033_000001.wav|"But what of that, child, pray?
4323_18416_000002_000001.wav|Two red spots burned on her cheeks, and her pale blue eyes snapped.
4323_18416_000019_000001.wav|So she was asked to sing at musicales and receptions without end, until Alexia exclaimed at last, "They are all raving, stark mad over her, and it's all Polly's own fault, the whole of it."
4323_18416_000022_000000.wav|"Yes, Grandpapa," said Phronsie, coming in and shutting the door carefully, "I came on purpose to see you all alone."
4323_18416_000066_000002.wav|Do out with it; I'm in no mood for a lecture, though, this morning."
4323_18416_000048_000001.wav|You may do anything you like, dear. There," mopping up her wet little face with his handkerchief, "now that's a good child; Phronsie, you are not going to cry, of course not. There, do smile a bit; that's my girl now," as a faint light stole into Phronsie's eyes.
4323_18416_000027_000001.wav|"But first, child, tell me what it is," and he stroked her yellow hair.
4323_18416_000064_000001.wav|"Besides, what would be the use, you never see anything encouraging about me or my career.
4323_18416_000018_000001.wav|And then he thought no more about it, and the bell ringing and mr Alstyne coming in, he went off into the library for a quiet chat.
4323_18416_000004_000000.wav|"That was I," said Charlotte; "I was the wild beast, Phronsie."
4323_18416_000064_000002.wav|And I believe I am going to the dogs."
4323_18416_000058_000000.wav|"I expect she's an awful nuisance," the old gentleman broke out suddenly.
4323_18416_000000_000001.wav|Then she sat down on the top step and clasped her hands.
4323_18416_000052_000000.wav|"Bless you, child," cried the old gentleman, much moved, "I wish I could say I believed what you say.
4323_18416_000041_000003.wav|"Does it make you sorry, Grandpapa dear, to have me want Charlotte to have the money with me?" she asked timidly.
4323_18416_000079_000000.wav|"Oh, nothing, nothing-I'm sure I didn't mean," cried mr Cabot, starting back suddenly in astonishment.
4323_18416_000061_000000.wav|"I was writing a note to mrs Fargo," said Phronsie, putting up her lips for a kiss.
4323_18416_000011_000001.wav|"Come, Charlotte."
4323_18416_000019_000000.wav|And after this, there were no more quiet days for Charlotte Chatterton. Everybody who was musical, wanted to revel in her voice; and everybody who wasn't, wanted the same thing because it was so talked about.
4323_18416_000008_000000.wav|"Oh, don't!" begged Charlotte, looking over at Polly.
4323_18416_000068_000001.wav|"Oh, hang it, Uncle, why can't you let me alone?"
4323_18416_000013_000002.wav|We're coming, boys," she called.
4323_18416_000044_000000.wav|"Yes, yes, of course; but you are too young to judge of such things," said the old gentleman decidedly, "as the giving away of property and all that."
4323_18416_000034_000000.wav|"If mrs Chatterton was aunt to Charlotte," persisted Phronsie slowly, "it seems as if Charlotte ought to have some of the money.
4323_18416_000056_000000.wav|"And, meantime," said mr King, quite satisfied, "why, Charlotte is having pretty good times, I think.
4323_18416_000075_000002.wav|"I got you in there."
4323_18416_000018_000000.wav|"Assuredly," said old mr King with great satisfaction in Polly's pleasure, and at her success in drawing Charlotte out.
4323_18416_000054_000000.wav|"Well, I won't, child," promised mr King, holding her close.
4323_18416_000075_000001.wav|It's the best law firm in the town, Pickering." mr Cabot brought his elbow off from the mantel enough to smite his palms together smartly in enthusiasm.
4323_18416_000069_000001.wav|It's my right, Pickering; you have no father to see to you, and I've always wanted to have the best success be yours." He turned away his head now, a break coming in his voice.
4323_18416_000067_000000.wav|"I'm not going to lecture you, my boy," said mr Cabot, closing the door, then going to the mantel to lean one elbow on it, a favorite attitude of his, while he scanned his nephew.
4323_18416_000014_000001.wav|It ran thus:
4323_18416_000053_000000.wav|"Oh, no, Grandpapa," protested Phronsie in a tone of horror, "they couldn't have been better.
4323_18416_000062_000000.wav|"Sure as I can be, Phronsie," said old mr King, smiling.
4323_18416_000041_000000.wav|Still no answer.
4323_18416_000031_000000.wav|"Charlotte poor?" repeated the old gentleman.
4323_18416_000021_000000.wav|"Come in!" called the old gentleman, "come in!
4323_18416_000028_000000.wav|"Grandpapa," asked Phronsie suddenly, "how much money did mrs Chatterton say I was to have?"
4323_18416_000045_000000.wav|"Oh, Grandpapa!" exclaimed Phronsie, in gentle reproach, and standing very tall.
4323_18416_000052_000001.wav|But many things in my life might have been bettered."
4323_18416_000061_000001.wav|"You are sure you won't make your head ache thinking about it, Grandpapa?" she asked anxiously.
4323_18416_000037_000000.wav|"Maybe," said the old gentleman, with a short laugh, "and I shouldn't wonder if Cousin Eunice was sorry over a few other things too, Phronsie."
4323_18416_000079_000001.wav|"Dear me, Pickering," taking off his eyeglasses to blow his nose, "you needn't pick me up so violently. I've been much worried about you," settling his glasses again for another look at his nephew.
4323_18416_000062_000001.wav|"Good by, dear."
4323_18416_000023_000000.wav|"So you did, dear," said mr King, highly gratified, and pushing away his writing table, he held out his hand.
4323_18416_000067_000001.wav|"But something worse than common has come to you.
4323_18416_000034_000001.wav|It really does, Grandpapa."
4323_18416_000027_000000.wav|"Well, then, Phronsie, if you want it, I suppose it must be," said mr King, quite as a matter of course.
4323_18416_000047_000000.wav|"Blame you?
4323_18416_000014_000000.wav|They had just finished dinner, when a note was handed Polly.
4323_18416_000035_000003.wav|And neither can we do anything now, but take matters as they are."
4323_18416_000055_000000.wav|"I won't, Grandpapa," said Phronsie obediently, and patting his broad back with her soft hand.
4323_18416_000035_000000.wav|"But Cousin Eunice didn't think so, else she'd have left it to Charlotte," said mr King abruptly, "and she did choose to leave it to you.
4323_18416_000029_000000.wav|"Oh, bless me!" exclaimed mr King, with a start.
4323_18416_000079_000002.wav|"And I can't tolerate any thoughts I cannot speak."
4323_18416_000002_000000.wav|Charlotte flung wide the door.
4323_18416_000016_000000.wav|"FELICIA a CABOT."
4323_18416_000002_000002.wav|But when she saw Polly, she said, "I'm sorry I frightened you, but I'm best alone."
4323_18416_000057_000000.wav|"Polly is making her have beautiful times," said Phronsie happily, "oh, very beautiful times indeed, Grandpapa."
4323_18416_000063_000000.wav|"See here, Pickering," mr Cabot threw wide the door of his private office with a nervous hand.
4323_18416_000056_000001.wav|Polly is looking out for that."
4323_18416_000021_000001.wav|Oh, bless me, it's you, Phronsie!" in pleased surprise.
4323_18416_000033_000000.wav|"Yes; that is, to Charlotte's father," corrected mr King.
4323_18416_000010_000000.wav|"I don't want any dinner," said Charlotte, drawing back.
4323_18416_000036_000000.wav|"I do think," said Phronsie, without taking her eyes from his face, "that maybe mrs Chatterton is sorry now, and wishes that she had left some money to Charlotte.
4323_18416_000054_000002.wav|It shall be just a secret between you and me."
4323_18416_000023_000001.wav|"Now, then, Phronsie, you are never going to be too big, you know, to sit on my knee, so hop up now."
4323_18416_000068_000000.wav|"No, no, don't ask me," ejaculated Pickering, striking his knee with one glove, and turning apprehensively in his chair.
4323_18416_000063_000002.wav|Come in; I never get one nowadays."
4323_18416_000047_000002.wav|But it was no use, and mr King caught her in time to see the quick drops roll down Phronsie's cheek and to feel them fall on his hand.
4323_18416_000042_000000.wav|"No, no, child," answered mr King hastily, "and yet I don't know what to say.
4323_18416_000025_000000.wav|"Well, my dear, what is it?" asked the old gentleman presently, "you've come to tell me something, I suppose."
4323_18416_000007_000001.wav|I did really, Charlotte."
4323_18416_000035_000002.wav|I didn't want you to have it, but the thing was fixed, and I couldn't help myself.
4323_18416_000047_000001.wav|Why, Grandpapa, I couldn't." Phronsie drew a long breath, then threw herself convulsively into his arms, her face working hard in her efforts not to cry.
4323_18416_000024_000000.wav|"Oh, no, Grandpapa," cried Phronsie in a rapture, "I could never be too big for that," so she perched up as of old on his knee, then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face.
4323_18416_000012_000000.wav|"Let me smooth your hair," begged Phronsie, standing on tiptoe; "do bend down just a very little, please.
4323_18416_000075_000000.wav|"Well, I can't say but that I was a good deal disturbed at one time," said mr Cabot frankly; "but never mind that now, you are through," and he heaved a sigh of relief, "and nicely established with Van Metre and Cartwright.
4323_18416_000072_000001.wav|But when he was there, he felt so much worse, that he soon got back into the old position.
4323_18416_000040_000000.wav|"Oh, I do so wish I might," she said, "there's so much for a little girl like me.
4323_18416_000000_000002.wav|"I heard it raging up and down."
4323_18416_000035_000001.wav|So there's an end of it, Phronsie.
4323_18416_000041_000002.wav|Then she spoke again.
4323_18416_000020_000000.wav|Phronsie laid down the note she was writing to mrs Fargo, a fortnight later, and said to herself, "I would better do it now, I think," and going out, she went deliberately to old mr King's room, and rapped at the door.
4323_18416_000077_000001.wav|It's enough to make a man go to the bad, to lose hope.
4323_18416_000049_000000.wav|"I couldn't," still said Phronsie, and it looked as if the shower were about to fall again.
4323_18416_000039_000001.wav|Phronsie stood a moment quite still where he left her, then she ran up to him and slipped her hand within his.
4323_18416_000040_000001.wav|It would be so nice to have Charlotte have some with me."
4323_18416_000013_000001.wav|There, they are coming after us," as quick footsteps sounded in the hall below. "Hurry, Charlotte, do.
4323_18416_000042_000001.wav|I don't feel that it would be right for you to give any of your money to her."
4323_18416_000039_000000.wav|For answer, mr King set her down hastily on the floor, and took two or three turns up and down the room.
4323_18416_000012_000001.wav|There, that's it," patting Charlotte's head with both hands; "now you look very nice; you really do-doesn't she, Polly."
4323_18416_000029_000002.wav|Oh, she left you everything she had, Phronsie; a couple of millions or so it is; why?"
4323_55228_000040_000001.wav|But, Bertram, what she wrote was true.
4323_55228_000002_000001.wav|Then he saw Aunt Hannah-Aunt Hannah with her bonnet askew, her neck bow awry, one hand bare, and the other half covered with a glove wrong side out.
4323_55228_000011_000000.wav|"mr Bertram is up and dressed, ma'am.
4323_55228_000050_000001.wav|Nonsense!" she cried.
4323_55228_000060_000002.wav|"Do you mean to say you really-"
4323_55228_000016_000000.wav|In the den neither Billy nor Bertram knew or cared what had become of Aunt Hannah and Pete.
4323_55228_000020_000000.wav|"You darling!
4323_55228_000092_000000.wav|"Yes, I know; that is a good while," cut in Bertram, airily.
4323_55228_000079_000000.wav|"But-"
4323_55228_000030_000000.wav|"There, there, dear," comforted Bertram, patting the bronze gold head on his breast.
4323_55228_000089_000001.wav|But that's only a week away," gasped Aunt Hannah.
4323_55228_000003_000001.wav|"As if you yourself didn't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night!"
4323_55228_000037_000000.wav|"Good heavens!
4323_55228_000087_000000.wav|"Your wedding!
4323_55228_000001_000000.wav|"Where is he, Pete?"
4323_55228_000022_000000.wav|"Why, Bertram, dear, don't you see?
4323_55228_000088_000001.wav|"It's next Tuesday, you see."
4323_55228_000060_000001.wav|Well, no!" exploded Bertram.
4323_55228_000072_000000.wav|"Billy, I'm going to marry you to morrow," he announced decisively.
4323_55228_000014_000001.wav|A flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch, with a low cry.
4323_55228_000087_000002.wav|Something in their smiling faces sent a quick suspicion to her eyes.
4323_55228_000077_000000.wav|"Five days, indeed, sir!
4323_55228_000075_000006.wav|Great Scott, Billy, I'll have to trust you five days, after all!
4323_55228_000051_000002.wav|But Billy looked him now straight in the face-it was a level, frank gaze of absolute truth.
4323_55228_000045_000001.wav|"That's what ailed me all the time I was painting that miserable portrait.
4323_55228_000084_000000.wav|"Billy, my dear!"
4323_55228_000009_000000.wav|"Billy stop!
4323_55228_000014_000000.wav|"mr Bertram," began Pete-but he got no further.
4323_55228_000020_000003.wav|"'As soon as,'" he quoted then scornfully.
4323_55228_000013_000001.wav|His face was turned toward the door, but his eyes were closed.
4323_55228_000031_000000.wav|Billy lifted her head.
4323_55228_000011_000002.wav|I'll speak to him."
4323_55228_000030_000004.wav|I'm loads better.
4323_55228_000003_000000.wav|"Of course it's she!" retorted Aunt Hannah, testily.
4323_55228_000030_000003.wav|That was what they were afraid of at first-that I'd lose my arm; but that danger is all past now.
4323_55228_000028_000000.wav|"Pete told you that I didn't care for any girl, only to paint?" demanded Bertram, angry and mystified.
4323_55228_000007_000001.wav|Oh, I'm so glad you came!
4323_55228_000007_000000.wav|"Miss Billy, Miss Billy, you're an angel straight from heaven, you are-you are!
4323_55228_000051_000000.wav|"And you never did think for a minute, Billy, that you cared for him?" Bertram's gaze searched Billy's face a little fearfully.
4323_55228_000023_000000.wav|"Well?" Bertram's voice was a little strained.
4323_55228_000077_000001.wav|I wonder if you think I can get ready to be married in five days."
4323_55228_000027_000001.wav|Pete told us," she broke off wildly, beginning to sob.
4323_55228_000090_000000.wav|"Yes, a week."
4323_55228_000038_000000.wav|"Well, she wrote a letter."
4323_55228_000015_000001.wav|Across his face swept such a radiant look of unearthly joy that Pete sobbed audibly and fled to the kitchen.
4323_55228_000010_000001.wav|The emphatic "we" and "us" were not lost on him. But his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke.
4323_55228_000006_000001.wav|His face was beaming, and his old eyes were shining.
4323_55228_000040_000002.wav|I found it everywhere, afterwards-in magazines and papers, and even in Marie."
4323_55228_000048_000001.wav|I was scared blue, Billy, with jealousy of-Arkwright."
4323_55228_000041_000001.wav|Well, dearie, I don't know yet what you found, but I do know you wouldn't have found it at all if it hadn't been for Kate-and I wish I had her here this minute!"
4323_55228_000074_000000.wav|"Bertram!
4323_55228_000081_000000.wav|"Bertram, do you-really?"
4323_55228_000089_000000.wav|"Next Tuesday!
4323_55228_000004_000000.wav|"Pete, where is he?" interposed Billy.
4323_55228_000050_000003.wav|I know he is!
4323_55228_000055_000000.wav|"Aren't lovers the beat'em for imagining things?" she murmured.
4323_55228_000086_000000.wav|"Yes, Aunt Hannah, I'll come; besides"--she glanced at Bertram mischievously-"I shall need all the time I've got to prepare for-my wedding."
4323_55228_000006_000000.wav|Pete had recovered himself by now, but he did not even glance toward Aunt Hannah.
4323_55228_000083_000000.wav|"Sweetheart, see here, dear," he cried softly, tightening his good left arm.
4323_55228_000048_000000.wav|"Well, I suppose I might as well own up now as any time.
4323_55228_000002_000003.wav|It was one matter for her to object to this thing Billy was doing-but quite another for Pete to do it.
4323_55228_000044_000000.wav|"Well, who's doing the marrying-she, or I?" "That's what I said, too-only in another way," sighed Billy.
4323_55228_000005_000001.wav|This time it was Aunt Hannah who gasped her name.
4323_55228_000061_000000.wav|Billy put a soft finger on his lips.
4323_55228_000039_000001.wav|Great Scott, Billy!
4323_55228_000004_000001.wav|"Tell mr Bertram I am here-or, wait!
4323_55228_000012_000000.wav|Pete, once again the punctilious butler, stalked to the door of Bertram's den and threw it wide open.
4323_55228_000068_000000.wav|Billy laughed.
4323_55228_000057_000000.wav|"You see-I wasn't in love with mr Arkwright."
4323_55228_000045_000000.wav|"Well, I can tell you right now, Billy, you will ruin it if you don't!" declared Bertram.
4323_55228_000078_000001.wav|"I saw Marie get ready, and I had all I wanted of it.
4323_55228_000076_000000.wav|Billy laughed softly.
4323_55228_000075_000004.wav|"Confound that law!
4323_55228_000071_000001.wav|Then, suddenly, Bertram stirred.
4323_55228_000075_000005.wav|I forgot.
4323_55228_000020_000001.wav|That was-" Bertram stopped suddenly.
4323_55228_000017_000001.wav|As if to make sure that she was "here, like this," he drew her even closer-Bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable.
4323_55228_000007_000003.wav|He's in the den, Miss Billy."
4323_55228_000088_000000.wav|"Yes," nodded Billy, demurely.
4323_55228_000000_000000.wav|With stiffly pompous dignity Pete opened the door.
4323_55228_000032_000000.wav|"Why, Billy," cried the man, in pained surprise.
4323_55228_000036_000000.wav|"Well, to begin with, Kate said-"
4323_55228_000063_000000.wav|Bertram kissed the finger and subsided.
4323_55228_000000_000001.wav|The next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed, flushed cheeked young woman who demanded:
4323_55228_000018_000000.wav|Billy, on her knees by the couch, snuggled into the curve of the one arm with a contented little sigh.
4323_55228_000066_000000.wav|"And you don't-after all, love me-just to paint?"
4323_55228_000073_000000.wav|Billy lifted her head and sat back in palpitating dismay.
4323_55228_000074_000001.wav|What an absurd idea!"
4323_55228_000029_000001.wav|It was all the others that told me that!
4323_55228_000026_000000.wav|Billy blushed.
4323_55228_000015_000003.wav|In the hall above Aunt Hannah was crying into William's gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack-Aunt Hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at Hillside.
4323_55228_000075_000003.wav|I'll get-" He stopped short, with a sudden frown.
4323_55228_000075_000007.wav|There's a new law about the license.
4323_55228_000058_000000.wav|"I see-I hope."
4323_55228_000011_000001.wav|He's in the den.
4323_55228_000046_000000.wav|"Lose me!
4323_55228_000087_000001.wav|You mean it'll be before-October?" Aunt Hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly.
4323_55228_000050_000002.wav|"Why, he's going to marry Alice Greggory.
4323_55228_000067_000001.wav|Is that Kate, too?" demanded Bertram, grimly.
4323_55228_000056_000000.wav|"They certainly are."
4323_55228_000075_000000.wav|"Well, I am.
4323_55228_000002_000000.wav|"Miss Billy!" gasped the old man.
4323_55228_000085_000000.wav|Billy rose at once as Aunt Hannah entered the room.
4323_55228_000053_000000.wav|"Thank God for that," breathed Bertram, as he drew the bright head nearer and held it close.
4323_55228_000042_000000.wav|Billy giggled hysterically.
4323_55228_000049_000000.wav|Billy laughed gayly-but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes.
4323_55228_000015_000000.wav|Bertram's eyes flew open.
4323_55228_000051_000001.wav|He had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids.
4323_55228_000002_000002.wav|Aunt Hannah's cheeks, too, were flushed, and her eyes starry, but with dismay and anger-the last because she did not like the way Pete had said Miss Billy's name.
4323_55228_000039_000000.wav|"I'll warrant she did!
4323_55228_000078_000000.wav|"Don't want you to get ready," retorted Bertram, promptly.
4323_55228_000039_000002.wav|Don't you know Kate by this time?"
4323_55228_000067_000000.wav|"Well, what is that?
4323_55228_000084_000001.wav|It was Aunt Hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway, a little later.
4323_55228_000013_000000.wav|Opposite the door, on a low couch, lay Bertram, his head bandaged, and his right arm in a sling.
4323_55228_000031_000001.wav|A look that was almost terror came to her eyes. She pulled herself half away from Bertram's encircling arm.
4323_55228_000022_000001.wav|When you were so troubled that the picture didn't go well, and I found out it was about me you were troubled-I-"
4323_55228_000075_000002.wav|I'm going to marry you to morrow.
4323_55228_000083_000001.wav|And forthwith he began to tell her how much he did, indeed, need her.
4323_55228_000071_000000.wav|There was another silence.
4323_55228_000030_000002.wav|As for my not painting again-you didn't understand Pete, dearie.
4323_55228_000050_000004.wav|I can see it as plain as day in her letters. He's there a lot."
4323_55228_000065_000000.wav|There was a long silence; then, a little breathlessly, Billy asked:
4323_55228_000078_000002.wav|If you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings we'll do it afterwards,--not before."
4323_55228_000050_000000.wav|"Arkwright?
4323_55228_000007_000002.wav|It'll be all right now-all right!
4323_55228_000084_000002.wav|"We must go home; and William is here, too, and wants to see you."
4323_55228_000008_000000.wav|Billy turned eagerly, but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall, Aunt Hannah's indignant voice arrested her.
4323_55228_000025_000001.wav|"May I ask why?"
4323_55228_000017_000000.wav|"But, dearest, what does it mean-you here like this?" asked Bertram then.
4323_55228_000010_000000.wav|Pete's lips twitched.
4323_55228_000009_000002.wav|Whatever angels do, young women don't go unannounced and unchaperoned into young men's rooms!
4323_55228_000015_000002.wav|Dong Ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over Bertram's tray.
4323_55228_000082_000000.wav|The tender glow on Billy's face told its own story, and Bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it.
4323_55228_000045_000002.wav|I was so worried-for fear I'd lose you."
4323_55228_000021_000000.wav|Billy's eyes widened a little.
4323_55228_000047_000000.wav|A shamed red crept to the man's forehead.
5849_50963_000034_000001.wav|"It is no wonder that they are all so happy to night."
5849_50963_000035_000000.wav|"Besides," added someone else, "they are all going to receive extra good pay, for the captain and mate will be very rich when the cargo is landed."
5849_50963_000024_000005.wav|I broke ten and injured more than I wanted to count."
5849_50963_000017_000002.wav|Of course, it was hard for the men who had families, McLaughlin especially; the others were all working sailors, but he was a landsman and my partner in the enterprise; but I will make it up to him, and the mahogany hunt will turn out the best paying piece of work he ever undertook."
5849_50963_000017_000001.wav|It would have taken us a lifetime to accumulate as much money as we have earned in this year.
5849_50963_000010_000000.wav|Here Mate McLaughlin told about the big storm and how long it took the small crew to repair the damage done to the sails.
5849_50963_000013_000000.wav|"We counted on getting home last week, when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course.
5849_50963_000005_000000.wav|And everybody was so happy.
5849_50963_000034_000000.wav|"And last night what an awful experience they had!" remarked one of the spectators.
5849_50963_000016_000000.wav|"Then it was well worth all your sacrifice?" said mr Minturn.
5849_50963_000011_000002.wav|Couldn't get things to eat without a lot of trouble, and couldn't go on with the carting until the authorities decided the fever was not serious.
5849_50963_000001_000000.wav|CHAPTER twenty
5849_50963_000003_000000.wav|A beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm.
5849_50963_000011_000003.wav|That was what delayed us so.
5849_50963_000030_000000.wav|The largest hotel at Sunset Beach was thrown open to the sailors that night, and here Captain Bingham and Mate McLaughlin, together with the rest of the crew, took up comfortable lodgings.
5849_50963_000009_000003.wav|Well, it was a long, slow job to drag those heavy logs around that point, and just when we were making headway, along comes a storm that drove the schooner and canoes out of business."
5849_50963_000009_000001.wav|"Of course I knew we were going to have trouble getting that mahogany.
5849_50963_000009_000002.wav|Two vessels had been wrecked trying to get it, so when we got to the West Indies I decided to try canoes and not risk sails, where the wind always blew such a gale, it dragged any anchor that could be dropped.
5849_50963_000033_000000.wav|How rugged and handsome the men looked!
5849_50963_000002_000000.wav|THE HAPPY REUNION
5849_50963_000015_000001.wav|"Well, I'm a rich man now, and so is my mate, McLaughlin, for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country, and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands."
5849_50963_000024_000000.wav|"Indeed I do not like shopping," answered the cousin.
5849_50963_000028_000000.wav|"Oh, I'll come if you make it jolly," answered Dorothy.
5849_50963_000018_000000.wav|"Oh, isn't it perfectly splendid!" declared Nan and Dorothy, hugging Nellie.
5849_50963_000017_000000.wav|"Yes, indeed.
5849_50963_000004_000000.wav|The sun seemed stronger each time it made its way out from behind a cloud, just as little girls and boys grow strong in body by exercise, and strong in character by efforts to do right.
5849_50963_000011_000001.wav|Well, then we were quarantined.
5849_50963_000021_000000.wav|"But we have to go to school," said Nan, "and we have only a few days more."
5849_50963_000026_000002.wav|He made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and I guess everybody was glad the army fell down.
5849_50963_000026_000000.wav|"No, she didn't, either," corrected Dorothy.
5849_50963_000019_000000.wav|"I can hardly believe it all," replied their little friend.
5849_50963_000027_000000.wav|"I hope you can come to Lakeport for Thanksgiving," said Nan.
5849_50963_000033_000001.wav|The rough ocean winds had tanned them like bronze, and their muscles were as firm and strong almost as the cables that swing out with the buoys.
5849_50963_000011_000000.wav|"Then we had to go back to work at the logs," went on the captain, "and then one of our crew took a fever.
5849_50963_000028_000001.wav|"If there is one thing in this world worth while, it is fun," and she tossed her yellow head about like a buttercup, that has no other way of laughing.
5849_50963_000018_000001.wav|"You will never again have to go back to that horrid store that made you so pale, and your mother will have a lovely time and nothing to worry about."
5849_50963_000020_000000.wav|"But all the same," sighed Dorothy, "I just know you will all be going home before we leave for the city, and I shall just die of loneliness."
5849_50963_000009_000000.wav|"There is not much to tell," began the captain.
5849_50964_000026_000001.wav|"It is not long until Thanksgiving.
5849_50964_000015_000001.wav|I wonder if all the other girls will be home at Lakeport in time for the first day of school?" said Nan.
5849_50964_000005_000000.wav|"You are quite rich now, aren't you?" remarked Dorothy.
5849_50964_000021_000001.wav|Dorothy gave Nan a beautiful little gold locket with her picture in it, and Flossie received the dearest little real shell pocketbook ever seen.
5849_50964_000023_000000.wav|And so our little friends had spent all their vacation.
5849_50964_000028_000001.wav|Look!" called Flossie, as the train made a turn, and whistled a good by to the Bobbsey Twins at the Seashore.
5849_50964_000012_000000.wav|"We might be able to manage that, too," Nellie told him.
5849_50964_000026_000000.wav|"I hope we will meet them all soon again," said Nan's mother.
5849_50964_000018_000000.wav|mr Bobbsey was down from the city, of course, to take the family home, and now all hands, even Freddie and Flossie, were busy packing up.
5849_50964_000004_000000.wav|"Oh, that will be splendid!" declared Nan.
5849_50964_000017_000000.wav|"So am I!" declared Nan.
5849_50964_000004_000001.wav|"Perhaps they will buy another tent with it, for they need more room out at Meadow Brook."
5849_50964_000007_000002.wav|Those we get down here always seem soft and salty, like the spray."
5849_50964_000007_000001.wav|"Be sure to have ice cream and chocolates-I want some good fresh chocolates.
5849_50964_000002_000000.wav|GOOD BY
5849_50964_000009_000000.wav|"Oh, yes, mother, I'm coming!" replied Nellie.
5849_50964_000026_000002.wav|Then, perhaps, we can give a real harvest party out at Lakeport and try to repay our friends for some of their hospitality to us."
5849_50964_000008_000000.wav|"Come, Nellie," called mrs McLaughlin, "I am ready.
5849_50964_000001_000000.wav|CHAPTER twenty one
5849_50964_000016_000001.wav|"Well, we have had a good vacation, and I am willing to go to work again."
5849_50964_000017_000001.wav|"Vacation was just long enough, I think."
5849_50964_000010_000000.wav|Bert had the donkey cart hitched and there was now no time to spare. Nellie kissed Freddie and Flossie affectionately, and promised to bring the little boy all through a big city, real fire engine house when he came to see her.
5849_50964_000024_000000.wav|The last night at the seashore was passed, and the early morning found them once more traveling away-this time for dear old home, sweet home.
5849_50964_000018_000001.wav|There were the shells to be looked after, the fish nets, besides Downy, the duck, and Snoop, the cat.
5849_50964_000008_000001.wav|Where is your hat?"
5849_50964_000003_000002.wav|Now father is home again, I can hardly believe it!
5849_50964_000007_000000.wav|"And we will be on hand, thank you," replied the joking Dorothy.
5849_50964_000025_000000.wav|"If we only didn't have to leave our friends," complained Nan, brushing back a tear, as the very last glint of Cousin Dorothy's yellow head passed by the train window.
5849_50964_000028_000000.wav|"There goes the last of the ocean.
5849_50964_000016_000000.wav|"Most of them, I guess," answered Bert.
5849_50962_000053_000000.wav|"And Hal and his father, too," put in Nan.
5849_50962_000015_000000.wav|"What's that board for?" asked Bert, as he saw a board following the cable.
5849_50962_000050_000001.wav|But I'm glad I came in to-the reception," he said, laughing.
5849_50962_000055_000000.wav|As mr Bingham told the guards it would not be necessary to haul any more men in, and as the sea was calm enough now to launch a life boat, both Nellie's father and Hal's uncle insisted on going back to the vessel to the other men.
5849_50962_000020_000001.wav|Its effect upon the sea was, however, more furious every hour, for while the storm had left the land, it was raging somewhere else, and the sensitive sea felt every throb of the excited elements.
5849_50962_000050_000003.wav|"And little Nellie!
5849_50962_000006_000000.wav|"Yes, come along," answered mr Minturn, and as day began to peep through the heavy clouds, the two hurried down to the spot where the life guards were burning their red light to tell the sailors their signal had been seen.

5849_50962_000004_000001.wav|mrs McLaughlin and her little daughter strained their eyes to see, if possible, what might be going on down at the beach.
5849_50962_000053_000001.wav|"It is just like a story in a book."
5849_50962_000031_000000.wav|Everybody gathered around, and Nellie with a strange face, and a stranger hope, broke through the crowd to see the rescued man.
5849_50962_000050_000000.wav|"I only came in to tell you," began George Bingham, "that we are all right, and the boat is lifting off the sand bar we stuck on.
5849_50962_000052_000000.wav|"Wasn't it perfectly splendid that Nellie and her mother were here!" declared Dorothy.
5849_50962_000058_000000.wav|What a morning that was at Sunset Beach!
5849_50962_000003_000000.wav|"Mother, mother!" called Nellie, "look down at the beach.
5849_50962_000029_000000.wav|A big roller dashing in finished the work for the life guards, and a man in the cork belt bounded upon shore.
5849_50962_000013_000001.wav|To this cord was fastened a heavy rope or cable.
5849_50962_000004_000000.wav|It was almost morning, but the black storm clouds held the daylight back.
5849_50962_000008_000000.wav|"Yes, that's the distress signal," replied the uncle.
5849_50962_000025_000001.wav|Here she comes!" called the crowd presently, as the black speck far out, and the strain on the cord, showed the buoy was coming back.
5849_50962_000026_000001.wav|Nearer and nearer it came, until now a man's head could be seen.
5849_50962_000039_000000.wav|mrs Bobbsey had been holding mrs McLaughlin back, but now the sailor was quite recovered, so they allowed her to speak to him.
5849_50962_000024_000000.wav|It seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning.
5849_50962_000043_000000.wav|"And is George Bingham out there?" anxiously asked the brother.
5849_50962_000060_000000.wav|"I'm so glad we prayed," said little Flossie to Freddie, when she heard the good news.
5849_50962_000007_000000.wav|"There's the vessel!" exclaimed Bert, as a rocket flew up from the water.
5849_50962_000048_000001.wav|George Bingham!"
5849_50962_000045_000001.wav|I guess our prayers were heard last night."
5849_50962_000030_000000.wav|He was quite breathless when the guards reached him, but insisted on walking up instead of being carried.
5849_50962_000003_000001.wav|The life guards are burning the red signal lights!
5849_50962_000002_000000.wav|LIFE SAVERS
5849_50962_000035_000000.wav|What a wonderful scene it was!
5849_50962_000010_000000.wav|"It's a schooner," said mr Bingham to mr Minturn, "and she has a very heavy cargo."
5849_50962_000022_000000.wav|mrs Bobbsey, mrs Minturn, Nellie and her mother, besides Dorothy and Nan, were all there; Flossie and Freddie being obliged to stay home with Dinah and Susan.
5849_50962_000057_000000.wav|Two boats were launched, a strong guard going in each, with mr McLaughlin in one and mr Bingham in the other, and now they pulled out steadily over the waves, back to the vessel that was freeing itself from the sand bar.

5849_50962_000044_000000.wav|"Safe and well," came the welcome answer.
5849_50962_000050_000002.wav|"So you've found friends, McLaughlin," he added, seeing the little family united. "Why, how do you do, mrs McLaughlin?" he went on, offering her his hand.
5849_50962_000019_000001.wav|"See, there goes the buoy," and then the queer looking life preserver made of cork, and shaped like breeches, swung out over the waves.
5849_50962_000048_000000.wav|"Hello there!" called mr Bingham: "Well, if this isn't luck.
5849_50962_000037_000000.wav|Even the guards, who were busy again at the ropes, having left the man to willing hands on the beach, could not hide their surprise over the fact that it was mother, father, and daughter there united under such strange conditions.
5849_50962_000051_000000.wav|Just as mr Bingham said, the life saving work turned out to be a social affair, for there was a great time greeting Nellie's father and Hal's uncle.
5849_50962_000042_000000.wav|"I am," replied the sailor.
5849_50962_000020_000000.wav|It was clear day now, and much of the wicked storm had passed.
5849_50962_000013_000000.wav|Instantly there shot out to sea a ball of thin cord.
5849_50962_000040_000000.wav|mr Bingham and Hal had been watching it all, anxiously.
5849_50962_000028_000000.wav|The girls and women were too frightened to talk, and Nellie clung close to her mother.
5849_50962_000025_000000.wav|"Here she comes!
5849_50962_000003_000002.wav|They have found a wreck!"
5849_50962_000018_000000.wav|"Oh, I see," said Bert, "the line will stretch then, and the breeches buoy will go out on a pulley."
5849_50962_000044_000001.wav|"Just waiting for his turn to come in."
5849_50962_000021_000000.wav|With the daylight came girls and women to the beach.
5849_50873_000096_000001.wav|"The imputation is false!"
5849_50873_000027_000002.wav|I am going to do something desperate.
5849_50873_000078_000001.wav|Marry! boy, have a care how you approach me.
5849_50873_000017_000000.wav|The day was well nigh spent, when he arrived, and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance.
5849_50873_000086_000000.wav|"Who of you has the charter?"
5849_50873_000062_000000.wav|Charles got as close to the long table used by the secretaries as possible, without attracting special attention.
5849_50873_000032_000000.wav|"mr Prince, our liberties are in danger, and there is no time to think of life.
5849_50873_000034_000001.wav|Won't you let me go with you?"
5849_50873_000065_000001.wav|I demand the charter at once.
5849_50873_000059_000000.wav|"By no means; but I want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission."
5849_50873_000064_000002.wav|When it ended, the governor of New York declared:
5849_50873_000027_000001.wav|It will give us time.
5849_50873_000041_000000.wav|"What lights?"
5849_50873_000000_000000.wav|The Stevens family was growing with the colonies.
5849_50873_000090_000002.wav|Where is he?
5849_50873_000095_000000.wav|"So this is another trick.
5849_50873_000087_000000.wav|"I have not," answered one.
5849_50873_000016_000000.wav|The members of the assembly were alarmed and amazed at his request.
5849_50873_000064_000001.wav|The debate was drawing to a close, or, in fact, had gone as far as it could, without arousing the suspicion of Governor Andros.
5849_50873_000004_000003.wav|On the very day of the arrival of Charles Stevens at Hartford, while he was talking with Captain Wadsworth, his aunt's husband, a member of the colonial assembly suddenly entered the house, his face flushed with excitement.
5849_50873_000084_000000.wav|"Where is the charter?" No one answered, and, with bosom swelling with indignation at being cheated by a device of the shrewd members of the assembly, he threatened to have them arrested.
5849_50873_000098_000001.wav|Once in the street they hastened away at a rapid pace.
5849_50873_000090_000001.wav|"I saw him; he struck my hand in the dark; yet I knew it was he.
5849_50873_000074_000002.wav|Though the lights were extinguished, through the windows the faint starlight dimly illuminated the scene.
5849_50873_000043_000000.wav|Captain Wadsworth went out, and on his way looked into the State house where everything was going as well as he could have wished.
5849_50873_000015_000001.wav|The members received him with the courtesy due to his rank.
5849_50873_000055_000000.wav|The sun was setting, and the captain said:
5849_50873_000042_000000.wav|"At the proper time, put out the lights in the assembly; but wait; I will go and muster the train bands, and have them at hand to prevent the governor's soldiers from injuring the members of the general assembly."
5849_50873_000054_000001.wav|Have no fear on that score."
5849_50873_000040_000000.wav|"Then you can put out the lights."
5849_50873_000099_000000.wav|"What are you going to do with it?" Charles asked.
5849_50873_000108_000000.wav|"We humbly prostrate ourselves, our privileges, our all, at the gracious feet of your majesty, with an entire resolution to serve you with faithful hearts."
5849_50873_000009_000001.wav|mr Prince, to convince him of the danger they were in, continued:
5849_50873_000103_000000.wav|"Stand a little way off, Charles," commanded the captain.
5849_50873_000039_000000.wav|"I am."
5849_50873_000014_000000.wav|"He shall not have it!"
5849_50873_000046_000000.wav|"Yes."
5849_50873_000104_000000.wav|Then, while Charles stood as sentry, he went to the tree and put the charter in the hollow.
5849_50873_000109_000003.wav|The people of Rhode Island were restive under the petty tyranny of Andros, and when they heard of the imprisonment of the despot at Boston, in sixteen eighty nine, they assembled at Newport, resumed popular government under the old charter, and began a new independent political career.
5849_50873_000028_000000.wav|mr Prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captain's face and read there a desperate determination.
5849_50873_000011_000000.wav|"I remember such an order, and furthermore that all the colonies complied with his infamous demand save Connecticut.
5849_50873_000085_000001.wav|"You have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of Connecticut ready to defend us against violence."
5849_50873_000065_000000.wav|"I have waited as long as I will.
5849_50873_000049_000001.wav|We have no wish to shed their blood.
5849_50873_000002_000000.wav|As the student of American history doubtless knows, the tyrannical Governor Andros of New York, claimed dominion over all that scope of country denominated as the New Netherland, a very indefinite term applied to a great scope of country extending from Maryland to the Connecticut River, to which point Andros claimed jurisdiction.
5849_50873_000069_000000.wav|There have been so many stories told of the Charter Oak that the author here feels justified in stepping aside from the narrative to quote from the journal for june fifteenth sixteen eighty seven, the following entry:

5849_50873_000005_000000.wav|"What has happened, mr Prince?" Wadsworth asked, for he could see that the man was greatly excited.
5849_50873_000077_000000.wav|"Uncle!"
5849_50873_000061_000000.wav|"Take your place, Charles, and be prepared to do your part," whispered Captain Wadsworth.
5849_50873_000081_000000.wav|"They have enough to do in there," answered the boy, pointing toward the meeting house, in which pandemonium seemed to reign.
5849_50873_000027_000000.wav|"Hasten back, mr Prince, and whisper in the ears of every member to prolong the debate.

5849_50873_000064_000000.wav|Time passed on, and darkness had enveloped the earth.
5849_50873_000105_000000.wav|As long as American students shall study the history of their country, will "The Charter Oak" be famous.

5849_50873_000045_000000.wav|"Charles, you see the soldiers of Governor Andros at the State house?"
5849_50873_000047_000001.wav|My train bands have their eyes on them."
5849_50873_000003_000000.wav|As early as sixteen seventy five, he went to the mouth of the Connecticut River with a small naval force, to assert his authority.

5849_50873_000104_000001.wav|Little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic.

5849_50873_000001_000000.wav|Charles Stevens, but a youth, was on a visit to Connecticut, when an event transpired, which has since become historical.
5849_50873_000020_000000.wav|He consented, however, to await the discussion; but as soon as it was ended, he declared that he would have the charter.
5849_50873_000000_000002.wav|They knew all their relatives in Virginia, Maryland and Carolinia.
5849_50873_000090_000000.wav|"It was the boy," cried the enraged governor.

5849_50873_000054_000000.wav|"I will do it at the exact moment, uncle.
5849_50873_000011_000001.wav|We have stubbornly refused to yield our charter voluntarily, for it is the guardian of our political rights."

5849_50873_000004_000001.wav|At the end of that period, a most exciting incident occurred at Hartford, during the visit of Charles Stevens to that city.

5849_50873_000006_000000.wav|"Governor Andros has come again," gasped mr Prince.
5849_50873_000015_000002.wav|Before that body, with armed men at his back, he demanded a formal surrender of the precious charter into his hands.

5849_50873_000012_000000.wav|"That is true, Captain Wadsworth," continued mr Prince, "and, to subdue our stubbornness, this viceroy has come to Hartford with sixty armed men, to demand the surrender of the charter in person."
5849_50873_000026_000000.wav|"He has promised to do so."
5849_50873_000008_000001.wav|"The liberties of the colony are involved.

1701_141759_000048_000000.wav|"Why should you be ashamed?"
1701_141759_000038_000001.wav|Him-I just shut my eyes and remember, but Boris...
1701_141759_000063_000002.wav|She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, who commanded the Guards.
1701_141759_000053_000002.wav|Anna Mikhaylovna, with the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess' door and paused.
1701_141759_000062_000005.wav|About some Denisov or other, though he himself, I dare say, is braver than any of them.
1701_141759_000018_000000.wav|"No, on my true word of honor," said Natasha, crossing herself, "I won't tell anyone!" and she ran off at once to Sonya.
1701_141759_000036_000003.wav|I don't remember him a bit."
1701_141759_000062_000002.wav|"And what a soul!
1701_141759_000024_000002.wav|"Now I'm very glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.
1701_141759_000033_000000.wav|"Do you remember him?" Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment's silence.
1701_141759_000034_000000.wav|Sonya smiled.
1701_141759_000028_000001.wav|"But perhaps she deceived you.
1701_141759_000040_000002.wav|But Natasha had not yet felt anything like it.
1701_141759_000031_000000.wav|"Hold your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!"
1701_141759_000055_000000.wav|The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.
1701_141759_000005_000000.wav|The count sobbed yet more.
1701_141759_000038_000000.wav|"It's not that I don't remember-I know what he is like, but not as I remember Nikolenka.
1701_141759_000038_000002.wav|No!" (She shut her eyes.) "No! there's nothing at all."
1701_141759_000063_000001.wav|Anna Mikhaylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son.
1701_141759_000062_000006.wav|He says nothing about his sufferings.
1701_141759_000040_000003.wav|She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
1701_141759_000051_000000.wav|"Petya, you're a stupid!" said Natasha.
1701_141759_000042_000002.wav|Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?
1701_141759_000047_000001.wav|I'm not going to."
1701_141759_000011_000000.wav|"No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won't give up-I know you know something."
1701_141759_000062_000009.wav|And how he has remembered everybody!
1701_141759_000059_000001.wav|"From all he says one should be glad and not cry."
1701_141759_000022_000000.wav|She rushed to Sonya, hugged her, and began to cry.
1701_141759_000029_000000.wav|Petya paced the room in silence for a time.
1701_141759_000028_000000.wav|"Thank God!" said Sonya, crossing herself.
1701_141759_000016_000001.wav|You won't?
1701_141759_000030_000000.wav|"If I'd been in Nikolenka's place I would have killed even more of those Frenchmen," he said.
1701_141759_000054_000001.wav|"Come later." And she went in, closing the door behind her.
1701_141759_000009_000000.wav|"Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!"
1701_141759_000054_000000.wav|"Don't come in," she said to the old count who was following her.
1701_141759_000062_000003.wav|Not a word about himself....
1701_141759_000020_000000.wav|"Nicholas!" was all Sonya said, instantly turning white.
1701_141759_000010_000000.wav|"Nothing, my dear."
1701_141759_000016_000002.wav|Then I will go and tell at once."
1701_141759_000003_000000.wav|Anna Mikhaylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still living with the Rostovs.
1701_141759_000043_000000.wav|"I don't know.
1701_141759_000032_000000.wav|"I'm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles," said Petya.
1701_141759_000023_000000.wav|"A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he wrote himself," said she through her tears.
1701_141759_000008_000004.wav|After dinner, she rushed head long after Anna Mikhaylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.
1701_141759_000014_000000.wav|"A letter from Nikolenka!
1701_141759_000042_000000.wav|Sonya became thoughtful.
1701_141759_000043_000001.wav|I think if he writes, I will write too," she said, blushing.
1701_141759_000062_000011.wav|I always said when he was only so high-I always said...."
1701_141759_000036_000000.wav|"No, Sonya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly, remember everything?" said Natasha, with an expressive gesture, evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning.
1701_141759_000062_000010.wav|Not forgetting anyone.
1701_141759_000053_000001.wav|On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes.
1701_141759_000036_000001.wav|"I remember Nikolenka too, I remember him well," she said.
1701_141759_000058_000000.wav|When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away the bald head.
1701_141759_000036_000002.wav|"But I don't remember Boris.
1701_141759_000061_000004.wav|Her son's growth toward manhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way.
1701_141759_000056_000001.wav|Anna Mikhaylovna opened the door.
1701_141759_000030_000001.wav|"What nasty brutes they are!
1701_141759_000041_000000.wav|"Shall you write to him?" she asked.
1701_141759_000056_000002.wav|Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill.
1701_141759_000024_000001.wav|It's true that all you women are crybabies," remarked Petya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides.
1701_141759_000049_000000.wav|"Well, I don't know.
1701_141759_000063_000004.wav|And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke's courier to Boris and Boris was to forward them to Nicholas.
1701_141759_000028_000002.wav|Let us go to Mamma."
1701_141759_000025_000000.wav|Natasha smiled through her tears.
1701_141759_000046_000000.wav|"no"
1701_141759_000047_000000.wav|"And I should be ashamed to write to Boris.
1701_141759_000008_000003.wav|Bold as she was, Natasha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikolenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess' remarks.
1701_141759_000062_000000.wav|"What a style!
1701_141759_000035_000000.wav|"Do I remember Nicholas?"
1701_141759_000062_000001.wav|How charmingly he describes!" said she, reading the descriptive part of the letter.
1701_141759_000062_000004.wav|Not a word!
1701_141760_000009_000003.wav|He wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss him-a thing everybody did.
1701_141760_000060_000001.wav|Were you there?"
1701_141760_000016_000000.wav|"Indeed?
1701_141760_000029_000000.wav|"Oh dear, what a beast I am!" muttered Rostov, as he read the letter.
1701_141760_000016_000002.wav|"And we too have had a splendid march.
1701_141760_000033_000000.wav|"What nonsense!
1701_141760_000048_000001.wav|"He would drink with you.
1701_141760_000013_000006.wav|Been under fire already?" asked Boris.
1701_141760_000018_000001.wav|"I say, send for some wine."
1701_141760_000010_000000.wav|They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young men take their first steps on life's road, each saw immense changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps.
1701_141760_000054_000008.wav|Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened.
1701_141760_000046_000000.wav|He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes, evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question.
1701_141760_000052_000010.wav|That's what keeping one's head means.
1701_141760_000059_000001.wav|"Come to me after the review and we will do what is possible."
1701_141760_000013_000003.wav|"I only sent you the note yesterday by Bolkonski-an adjutant of Kutuzov's, who's a friend of mine.
1701_141760_000009_000004.wav|But notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.
1701_141760_000003_000004.wav|Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily.
1701_141760_000013_000005.wav|Well, how are you?
1701_141760_000054_000010.wav|His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on.
1701_141760_000063_000003.wav|Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!"
1701_141760_000001_000000.wav|On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov's active army, in camp before Olmutz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors-the Russian and the Austrian.
1701_141760_000051_000001.wav|Berg returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated.
1701_141760_000067_000002.wav|However," he added rising, "you know my name and where to find me, but don't forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the matter drop.
1701_141760_000034_000000.wav|"Why have you thrown that away?" asked Boris.
1701_141760_000042_000000.wav|"Well, as you see.
1701_141760_000066_000001.wav|I am speaking of the staff in general."
1701_141760_000016_000001.wav|Yes, yes!" said Boris, with a smile.
1701_141760_000026_000001.wav|I quite understand," said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.
1701_141760_000013_000002.wav|"I did not expect you today," he added.
1701_141760_000003_000006.wav|Berg and Boris, having rested after yesterday's march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess.
1701_141760_000027_000000.wav|"Go across to our hosts: they invited you," added Boris.
1701_141760_000011_000002.wav|The German landlady, hearing Rostov's loud voice, popped her head in at the door.
1701_141760_000003_000001.wav|They had come by easy stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place.
1701_141760_000052_000007.wav|Still I remained silent.
1701_141760_000019_000000.wav|Boris made a grimace.
1701_141760_000025_000001.wav|Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!" he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, "Don't be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance."
1701_141760_000055_000001.wav|Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Boris, who had managed to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted.
1701_141760_000068_000002.wav|He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode home.
1701_141760_000016_000003.wav|You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every advantage.
1701_141760_000002_000002.wav|The Pavlograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.
1701_141760_000055_000005.wav|Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.
1701_141760_000048_000002.wav|I can't."
1701_141760_000058_000000.wav|Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled.
1701_141760_000013_000004.wav|I did not think he would get it to you so quickly....
1701_141760_000052_000009.wav|The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day.
1701_141760_000016_000006.wav|I can't tell you.
1701_141760_000016_000005.wav|What dinners and balls!
1701_141760_000056_000000.wav|In spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the contempt with which Rostov, from his fighting army point of view, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one, Rostov felt confused, blushed, and became silent.
1701_141760_000036_000001.wav|"This letter would be of great use to you."
1701_141760_000012_000000.wav|"Eh, is she pretty?" he asked with a wink.
1701_141760_000051_000003.wav|They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of his kindness and irascibility.
1701_141760_000059_000000.wav|"As to your business," Prince Andrew continued, addressing Boris, "we will talk of it later" (and he looked round at Rostov).
1701_141760_000039_000000.wav|"It's a lackey's job!"
1701_141760_000024_000001.wav|"As for us, Count, we get along on our pay.
1701_141760_000052_000004.wav|It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is.
1701_141760_000011_000001.wav|Clean and fresh as if you'd been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line," cried Rostov, with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Boris, pointing to his own mud bespattered breeches.
1701_141760_000016_000004.wav|What receptions we had in Poland!
1701_141760_000008_000000.wav|"Dear me, how you have changed!"
1701_141760_000054_000011.wav|And so he told them all that.
1701_141760_000011_000000.wav|"Oh, you damned dandies!
1701_141760_000056_000001.wav|Boris inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.
1701_141760_000063_000002.wav|But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire!
1701_141760_000037_000000.wav|"I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's adjutant."
1701_141760_000003_000007.wav|Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.
1701_141760_000007_000001.wav|"And Berg too!
1701_141760_000041_000001.wav|But that's not the point...
1701_141760_000042_000001.wav|So far everything's all right, but I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front."
1701_141760_000010_000001.wav|Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.
1701_141760_000064_000000.wav|"Of whom you imagine me to be one?" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and particularly amiable smile.
1701_141760_000024_000002.wav|I can tell you for myself..."
1701_141760_000051_000005.wav|With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: "Arnauts!" ("Arnauts" was the Tsarevich's favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the company commander.
1701_141760_000004_000000.wav|"Well, how are you going to get out of that?" he remarked.
1701_141760_000023_000001.wav|After reading a few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the letter.
1701_141760_000043_000000.wav|"Why?"
1701_141760_000063_000000.wav|"Yes, stories!" repeated Rostov loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at Boris, now at Bolkonski.
1701_141760_000003_000000.wav|The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading their cleanliness and discipline.
1701_141760_000063_000001.wav|"Yes, many stories!
1701_141760_000054_000001.wav|He asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound.
1701_141760_000001_000001.wav|The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review, reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock.
1701_141760_000002_000006.wav|He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a soldier's cross, equally shabby cadet's riding breeches lined with worn leather, and an officer's saber with a sword knot.
1701_141760_000038_000000.wav|"Why not?" inquired Boris.
1701_141760_000006_000000.wav|At that moment the door opened.
1701_141760_000025_000000.wav|"I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rostov, "when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with, and I happen to be there, I'll go at once, to be out of your way!
1701_141760_000050_000000.wav|"He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow," answered Boris.
1701_141760_000055_000000.wav|In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: "You cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack," Prince Andrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered the room.
1701_141760_000009_000000.wav|Boris rose to meet Rostov, but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling.
8288_274150_000017_000000.wav|"Go then, dearest love," said the king, "but return quickly."
8288_274150_000011_000010.wav|Suddenly, a noise upon the upper floor was heard, which had, in fact, continued, though it had remained unnoticed, for some time; it had at last aroused La Valliere's attention, though but slowly so.

6455_67804_000046_000003.wav|I never killed a man in my life."
6455_67804_000053_000001.wav|"Have you any message for my mother?
6455_67804_000017_000001.wav|Friend with me.
6455_67804_000026_000001.wav|She's prettier than ever to day, and is enjoying herself."
6455_67804_000036_000000.wav|"Very few people understand Octavia," said Miss Belinda.
6455_67804_000003_000000.wav|"Going to a funeral?" he demanded.
6455_67804_000014_000000.wav|"I beg you will not speak to me of that again," she said: "I will not listen." And turning about, she walked out of the room.
6455_67804_000021_000000.wav|"Well," remarked Octavia, "I suppose that would have been an advantage."
6455_67804_000037_000001.wav|He was not very comfortable.
6455_67804_000005_000006.wav|When I find a fellow who's neither knave nor fool, I stick to him.
6455_67804_000018_000000.wav|"MARTIN BASSETT."
6455_67804_000007_000001.wav|"I made it myself."
6455_67804_000012_000001.wav|I shall not be afraid again."
6455_67804_000012_000000.wav|"No," she answered: "I am not afraid at all.
6455_67804_000057_000000.wav|"Nothing whatever," he replied.
6455_67804_000035_000000.wav|"Ah!" commented Barold.
6455_67804_000027_000001.wav|mr Francis Barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart.
6455_67804_000044_000002.wav|Don't deride my youth and ignorance, Miss Bassett."
6455_67804_000024_000002.wav|She is usually paler.
6455_67804_000016_000001.wav|Before breakfast Miss Belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram, which ran as follows:--
6455_67804_000044_000001.wav|"I say, what a name!
6455_67804_000050_000000.wav|"I had not observed it," answered her ladyship.
6455_67804_000034_000000.wav|"Octavia is most happy to day," answered Miss Belinda.
6455_67804_000036_000003.wav|She-she has very pretty ways.
6455_67804_000004_000000.wav|"I accompany my granddaughter to this-this entertainment," her ladyship responded.
6455_67804_000005_000008.wav|Where's Lucia?"
6455_67804_000036_000001.wav|"I'm not sure that I follow all her moods myself.
6455_67804_000046_000000.wav|"I would rather try the other, thank you," he laughed.
6455_67804_000043_000000.wav|"If you go to Nevada, you must visit the mines at Bloody Gulch," she said.
6455_67804_000034_000001.wav|"Her father will reach Slowbridge this evening.
6455_67804_000004_000001.wav|"It is scarcely a joyous occasion, to my mind."
6455_67804_000055_000000.wav|"What has happened?" she asked rigidly.
6455_67804_000000_000001.wav|Lady Theobald's manner was chiefly distinguished by an implacable rigidity.
6455_66379_000011_000000.wav|The game went on, and the paddles kept moving.
6455_66379_000016_000001.wav|This wood seems rather better than that we took in at Yellow Face's, but we're nearly out again, and must be looking out for more.
6455_66379_000001_000000.wav|"Hallo, Colonel!
6455_66379_000020_000002.wav|(Deal, sir, if you please; better luck next time.)"
6455_66379_000025_000000.wav|The pilots here changed places.
6455_66379_000028_000002.wav|We were nearing the shore, for the purpose of looking for wood, the banks being invisible from the middle of the river.
6455_66379_000014_000003.wav|Still, with all these disadvantages, they continued playing-they wanted to learn the game.
6455_66379_000027_000000.wav|Day at length dawned.
6455_66379_000030_000000.wav|"Hallo! the woodyard!"
6455_66379_000010_000002.wav|Hand over those V's.)."
6455_66379_000032_000000.wav|"What's the price of wood?"
6455_66379_000013_000000.wav|The wooding completed, we paddled on again.
6455_67803_000021_000000.wav|She wondered if he had heard her last words: she fancied he had.
6455_67803_000016_000000.wav|She walked very fast, after she left the house.
6455_67803_000002_000002.wav|Grandmamma"--She stopped short, and colored, and drew her slight figure up.
6455_67803_000012_000001.wav|It is!" she said.
6455_67803_000016_000004.wav|But it was not against him that Lucia's indignation was aroused.
6455_67803_000020_000001.wav|Burmistone!"
6455_67803_000014_000002.wav|If she had only thought of it because mr Binnie came, I could have forgiven her more easily; but she has been making coarse plans all the time, and treating me with contempt.
6455_67803_000031_000000.wav|"I don't want to be cool," she said.
6455_67803_000034_000009.wav|Is it enough?"
6455_67803_000006_000000.wav|"She was afraid to tell me in plain words.--I never saw her afraid before, but she was afraid.
6455_67803_000038_000001.wav|"Let me go to her.
6455_67803_000020_000000.wav|"mr Burmistone!" she said: "mr
6455_67803_000038_000000.wav|"Yes," he answered.
6455_67803_000002_000001.wav|"He has a great deal of money.
6455_67803_000011_000000.wav|Lucia thought deeply for a moment: she recognized, all at once, several things she had been mystified by before.
6455_67803_000016_000002.wav|mr Dugald Binnie had not proved to be a very fascinating person.
6455_67803_000014_000003.wav|Octavia," she added, turning upon her, with flushing cheeks and sparkling eyes, "I think that, for the first time in my life, I am in a passion,--a real passion.
6455_67803_000006_000004.wav|Do you wonder that it took even Lady Theobald a long time to say that?"
6455_67803_000012_000000.wav|"Oh, it is!
6455_67803_000031_000001.wav|But he drew her gently with him; and a few steps took them into the shade of the young oaks and pines, and there he paused.
6455_67803_000013_000001.wav|Lucia sat thinking, her hands clasped tightly.
6455_67803_000005_000000.wav|"What did you understand?"
6455_67803_000017_000002.wav|never!"
6455_67803_000014_000004.wav|I think I shall never be afraid of her any more." Her delicate nostrils were dilated, she held her head up, her breath came fast.
6455_67803_000016_000003.wav|He was an acrid, dictatorial old man: he contradicted Lady Theobald flatly every five minutes, and bullied his man servant.
6455_67803_000002_000000.wav|"He is my grand uncle," explained Lucia tremulously.
6455_67803_000025_000000.wav|"I am angry!" she said.
6455_67803_000003_000000.wav|"What did she say?" inquired Octavia.
6455_67803_000036_000000.wav|"Lucia," he said, "I wish you would let me go and talk with Lady Theobald."
6455_67803_000009_000000.wav|"How did you guess?" she exclaimed.
6455_67803_000014_000007.wav|And I am not afraid of her at all.
6455_67803_000033_000000.wav|And then, almost before she knew what she was doing, she was pouring forth the whole of her story, even more of it than she had told Octavia. She had not at all intended to do it; but she did it, nevertheless.
6455_67803_000027_000001.wav|She laughed again.
6455_67803_000027_000000.wav|"What are you going to say to her?" he asked.
6455_67803_000000_000001.wav|Dugald Binnie is at Oldclough."
6455_67803_000025_000001.wav|"You have never seen me angry before.
6455_67803_000014_000000.wav|"I am glad I came here," she said, at length.
6455_67803_000023_000000.wav|She knew there would be no use in trying to conceal the truth, and she was not in the mood to make the effort.
6455_67803_000007_000000.wav|"Well," remarked Octavia, "you won't do it, I suppose.
6455_67803_000001_000000.wav|"Who is he?"
6455_67803_000023_000001.wav|She scarcely knew herself.
6455_67803_000014_000008.wav|I will go home and tell her what I think."
6455_67803_000014_000005.wav|There was a hint of exultation in her tone.
6455_67803_000006_000003.wav|If I make the marriage she chooses, she thinks mr Binnie will leave me his money. I am to run after a man who does not care for me, and make myself attractive, in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mr Binnie may leave me his money.
6455_67803_000017_000001.wav|"Never!
6455_67803_000028_000000.wav|"I am going to ask her what she means.
6123_59150_000022_000002.wav|"Dostoevsky," he declares, "is not a novelist.
6123_59150_000025_000000.wav|Dostoevsky's people, it is suggested, "are not so much men and women as disembodied spirits who have for the moment put on mortality."
6123_59150_000009_000002.wav|Even the talk is of actions more than of ideas.
6123_59150_000021_000003.wav|That is characteristic at once of Dostoevsky's mastery and his monstrous profusion.
6123_59150_000018_000001.wav|"If I haven't killed him, I'll come again and kill him."
6123_59150_000019_000001.wav|Incident follows breathlessly upon incident.
6123_59150_000006_000004.wav|But it is the sensational drama of a cruel world that most persistently haunts his imagination.
6123_59150_000016_000003.wav|Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away.
6123_59150_000011_000000.wav|One would not accept that incident from any Western author.
6123_59150_000019_000003.wav|His people are energetic and untamed, like cowboys or runaway horses.
6123_59150_000008_000005.wav|His world is an inferno.
6123_59150_000004_000001.wav|He may in the last analysis be a great mystic or a great psychologist; but he almost always reveals his genius on a stage crowded with people who behave like the men and women one reads about in the police news.
6123_59150_000022_000001.wav|So incongruous, indeed, is the sensational framework of his stories with the immense and sombre genius that broods over them that mr Murry is inclined to regard the incidents as a sort of wild spiritual algebra rather than as events occurring on the plane of reality.
6123_59150_000016_000001.wav|He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face.
6123_59150_000013_000000.wav|One does not grudge an artist an abnormal character or two.
6123_59150_000032_000001.wav|The face was that of a Russian peasant; a real Moscow mujik, with a flat nose, small, sharp eyes deeply set, sometimes dark and gloomy, sometimes gentle and mild.
6123_59150_000007_000002.wav|He does also portray an almost Christ like love, a love that is outside the body and has the nature of a melting and exquisite charity.
6123_59150_000010_000005.wav|He took a knife, and when his friend had turned away, he approached him cautiously from behind, took aim, turned his eyes heavenwards, crossed himself, and praying fervently "God forgive me, for Christ's sake!" he cut his friend's throat at one stroke like a sheep and took his watch.
6123_59150_000011_000004.wav|The crimes in his books seem to spring, not from more or less rational causes, but from some seed of lunacy.
6123_59150_000027_000001.wav|Dostoevsky was no realist.
6123_59150_000018_000000.wav|"Serve him right!" shouted Dmitri, breathlessly.
6123_59150_000012_000006.wav|He is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity and passion.
6123_59150_000002_000000.wav|DOSTOEVSKY THE SENSATIONALIST
6123_59150_000011_000003.wav|Yet to Dostoevsky such aberrations of conduct make a continuous and overwhelming appeal.
6123_59150_000015_000000.wav|As for the Karamazovs themselves, he portrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs:
6123_59150_000032_000004.wav|When he became excited on a certain point, one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated on a bench in a police court awaiting trial, or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors.
6123_59150_000007_000004.wav|But they are never in balance; they are always in demoniacal conflict.
6123_59150_000031_000001.wav|The novels are the perfect image of the man.
6123_59150_000009_000006.wav|Here, for example, is a characteristic Dostoevsky story put in the Prince's mouth:
6123_59150_000026_000000.wav|They have no physical being.
6123_59150_000008_000004.wav|The cry is, I fancy, repeated in others of Dostoevsky's novels.
6123_59150_000026_000002.wav|Because they are possessed they are no longer men and women.
6123_59150_000022_000000.wav|But the secret of Dostoevsky's appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters.
6123_59150_000032_000003.wav|His drawn, twitching features seemed to press down on his sad looking mouth.... Eyelids, lips, and every muscle of his face twitched nervously the whole time.
6123_59150_000014_000000.wav|was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with great ceremony.
6123_59150_000007_000007.wav|It is always lust with a knife.
6123_59150_000029_000003.wav|It is surely a kind of faith, though a despairing kind.
6123_59150_000019_000002.wav|No melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty.
6123_59150_000003_000001.wav|And so there is.
6123_59150_000029_000005.wav|His work is all earthquake and eclipse and dead stars apart from this.
6123_59150_000029_000004.wav|And beyond the dark night of suffering, and dissipating the night, Dostoevsky still sees the light of Christian compassion.
6123_59150_000027_000002.wav|Nor, on the other hand, was he a novelist of horrors for horrors' sake.
6123_59150_000010_000003.wav|The man was not a thief; he was an honest man, in fact, and by a peasant's standard by no means poor.
6123_59150_000021_000000.wav|It is one of the triumphs of his genius that, however many persons he introduces, he never allows them to be confused into a hopeless chaos. His story finds its way unimpeded through the mob.
6123_59150_000005_000003.wav|If Dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been Strindberg.
6123_59150_000010_000001.wav|Two peasants, middle aged men, friends who had known each other for a long time and were not drunk, had had tea and were meaning to go to bed in the same room.
6123_59150_000005_000004.wav|If his vision had been aesthetic and sensual, he might have been D'Annunzio.
6123_59150_000024_000001.wav|And those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly, mean tavern, set in surrounding darkness.
6123_59150_000007_000005.wav|Their ups and downs are like the ups and downs in a fight between cat and dog.
6123_59150_000013_000001.wav|Dostoevsky, however, has created a whole flock of these abnormal characters and watches over them as a hen over her chickens.
6123_59150_000016_000002.wav|The old man moaned shrilly.
6123_59150_000010_000000.wav|In the evening I stopped for the night at a provincial hotel, and a murder had been committed there the night before....
6123_59150_000007_000003.wav|He sometimes even portrays the two kinds of love in the same person.
6123_59150_000013_000002.wav|He invents vicious grotesques as Dickens invents comic grotesques.
6123_59150_000023_000001.wav|To him Dostoevsky's work is "the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life; it is more than a record of struggle, it is the struggle itself." Dostoevsky himself is a man of genius "lifted out of the living world," and unable to descend to it again.
6123_59150_000027_000000.wav|This is all in a measure true.
6123_59150_000007_000001.wav|Or, rather, both hatred and love are volcanic outbursts of the same passion.
6123_59150_000028_000001.wav|mr Murry will have it that the actions in the novels take place in a "timeless" world, largely because Dostoevsky has the habit of crowding an impossible rout of incidents into a single day.
6123_59150_000017_000000.wav|"Madman!
6123_59150_000012_000004.wav|We sympathize, indeed, with the fears, the bravado, the despair that succeed the crime.
6123_59150_000031_000000.wav|His work, like his face, bears the mark of this terrible conflict.
6123_59150_000020_000001.wav|Scenes that in an ordinary novel would take place with two or three figures on the stage are represented in Dostoevsky as taking place before a howling, seething mob.
6123_59150_000008_000001.wav|His passions are such as come before the criminal rather than the civil courts.
6123_59150_000007_000000.wav|Love itself is with him, as with Strindberg and D'Annunzio, for the most part only a sort of rearrangement of hatred.
6123_59150_000017_000001.wav|You've killed him!" cried Ivan.
6123_59150_000004_000003.wav|His people more nearly resemble madmen and wild beasts than normal human beings.
6123_59150_000006_000000.wav|Like them, he is a novelist of torture.
6123_59150_000024_000000.wav|For an awful moment I seem to see things with the eye of eternity, and have a vision of suns grown cold, and hear the echo of voices calling without sound across the waste and frozen universe.
6123_59150_000016_000004.wav|Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.
6123_59150_000009_000003.wav|Dostoevsky's characters describe the execution of a criminal, the whipping of an ass, the torture of a child.
6123_59150_000019_000004.wav|They might be described as runaway human beings.
6123_59150_000009_000001.wav|There was never so much talk in any other novels, and there was never so much action.
6123_59150_000004_000000.wav|Dostoevsky's visible world was a world of sensationalism.
6123_59150_000008_000002.wav|His people are possessed with devils as the people in all but religious fiction have long ceased to be.
6123_59150_000021_000002.wav|And yet practically all of them remain separate and created beings.
6123_59150_000005_000000.wav|He releases them from most of the ordinary inhibitions.
6123_59150_000009_000000.wav|One result of this is a multiplicity of action.
6123_59150_000023_000000.wav|mr Murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition.
6123_59150_000030_000000.wav|He does not, mr Murry urges, believe, as has often been said, that men are purified by suffering.
6123_59186_000047_000000.wav|We must, then, be grateful without niggardliness for the gift of his verse.
6123_59186_000014_000000.wav|What one does bless mr Hardy for, however, both in his verse and in his prose, is his bleak sincerity.

4570_14911_000003_000005.wav|It is so much a matter of individual taste.
4570_14911_000009_000004.wav|NECK-Moderately long, slightly arched, the throat showing some dewlap.
4570_14911_000009_000010.wav|COLOUR-Any recognised hound colour.
4570_14911_000009_000001.wav|NOSE-Black, broad, and nostrils well expanded.
4570_14911_000002_000002.wav|Nevertheless, in general appearance the Harrier and the Foxhound are very much alike, the one obvious distinction being that of size.

4570_14911_000009_000012.wav|Rough variety: Very dense and wiry. HEIGHT-Not exceeding sixteen inches.
4570_14911_000003_000007.wav|As in the case of the Foxhound, the Harrier is very seldom kept as a companion apart from the pack.
4570_14911_000009_000002.wav|EYES-Brown, dark hazel or hazel, not deep set nor bulgy, and with a mild expression.

4570_14911_000009_000000.wav|DESCRIPTION OF THE BEAGLE: HEAD-Fair length, powerful without being coarse; skull domed, moderately wide, with an indication of peak, stop well defined, muzzle not snipy, and lips well flewed.
4570_14911_000009_000009.wav|STERN-Moderate length, set on high, thick and carried gaily, but not curled over the back.
4570_24733_000006_000001.wav|Therefore the idea of God expressed in thought, or anything which necessarily follows from the absolute nature of some attribute of God, cannot have a limited duration, but through the said attribute is eternal, which is our second point. Bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything, which in any attribute necessarily follows from God's absolute nature.
4570_24733_000004_000001.wav|Wherefore, if the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought, or, indeed, anything else in any attribute of God (for we may take any example, as the proof is of universal application) follows from the necessity of the absolute nature of the said attribute, the said thing must necessarily be infinite, which was our first point.
4570_24733_000007_000001.wav|Whatsoever follows from any attribute of God, in so far as it is modified by a modification, which exists necessarily and as infinite, through the said attribute, must also exist necessarily and as infinite.
4570_24733_000017_000000.wav|Corollary.--Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.
4570_24733_000008_000000.wav|Proof.--The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the preceding one.
4570_24733_000005_000000.wav|Furthermore, a thing which thus follows from the necessity of the nature of any attribute cannot have a limited duration.
4570_24733_000013_000000.wav|Corollary.--Hence it follows that God is not only the cause of things coming into existence, but also of their continuing in existence, that is, in scholastic phraseology, God is cause of the being of things (essendi rerum).
4570_24733_000005_000001.wav|For if it can, suppose a thing, which follows from the necessity of the nature of some attribute, to exist in some attribute of God, for instance, the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought, and let it be supposed at some time not to have existed, or to be about not to exist.
4570_24733_000003_000000.wav|Proof.--Conceive, if it be possible (supposing the proposition to be denied), that something in some attribute of God can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute, and that at the same time it is finite, and has a conditioned existence or duration; for instance, the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought.
4570_24733_000012_000001.wav|For that of which the nature (considered in itself) involves existence is self-caused, and exists by the sole necessity of its own nature.
4570_24733_000003_000002.wav|But, in so far as it possesses the idea of God, it is supposed finite.
4570_24733_000013_000001.wav|For whether things exist, or do not exist, whenever we contemplate their essence, we see that it involves neither existence nor duration; consequently, it cannot be the cause of either the one or the other.
4570_24733_000011_000001.wav|The essence of things produced by God does not involve existence.
4570_24733_000016_000001.wav|This will be made still clearer by the following corollary.
4570_24733_000009_000001.wav|Every mode, which exists both necessarily and as infinite, must necessarily follow either from the absolute nature of some attribute of God, or from an attribute modified by a modification which exists necessarily, and as infinite.
4570_24733_000002_000001.wav|All things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of God must always exist and be infinite, or, in other words, are eternal and infinite through the said attribute.
4570_24733_000004_000000.wav|We have now granted, therefore, thought not constituting the idea of God, and, accordingly, the idea of God does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought (for it is conceived as constituting, and also as not constituting, the idea of God), which is against our hypothesis.
4570_24733_000014_000001.wav|God is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things, but also of their essence.

6267_65525_000021_000005.wav|I wanted to ride on so forever, straight into the heart of the sunset.
6267_65525_000028_000001.wav|I had a delightful run away.
6267_65525_000026_000003.wav|As it was, I had contradicted him twice, and he had laughed and liked it.
6267_65525_000048_000004.wav|He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook.
6267_65525_000014_000005.wav|He was two years out from the east, and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times.

6267_65525_000001_000009.wav|Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing, crying, quarrelling children, and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl's disgusted nostrils.

6267_65525_000020_000003.wav|I love life and its bloom and brilliancy; I love meeting new people; I love the ripple of music, the hum of laughter and conversation.
6267_65525_000013_000001.wav|One such request went from Sidney under the pen name of "Ellen Douglas." The girl was lonely in Plainfield; she had no companions or associates such as she cared for; the Maple Leaf Club represented all that her life held of outward interest, and she longed for something more.

6267_65525_000047_000001.wav|And there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible.
6267_65525_000060_000003.wav|We are poor. Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination."
6267_65525_000062_000003.wav|So I wrote instead of the life I wanted to live-the life I did live in imagination.
6267_65525_000004_000004.wav|But she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter.
6267_65525_000007_000003.wav|It seemed to her to typify all that was unlovely in her life.
6267_65525_000006_000000.wav|She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow.
6267_65525_000015_000001.wav|Since then they had written to each other regularly.
6267_65525_000067_000001.wav|And for my own part, I am glad you are not what I have always thought you were.
6267_65525_000001_000004.wav|This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life.
6267_65525_000021_000000.wav|The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey mare Lady.

6267_65525_000025_000004.wav|He talked of books and music, of art and travel.
6267_65525_000047_000003.wav|Perhaps he had meant some other james Conway.
6267_65525_000026_000004.wav|But his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth, through the insight he himself has given me.

6267_65525_000059_000000.wav|"Then, those letters-"
6267_65525_000025_000000.wav|I hadn't thought about him before-I hadn't even caught his name in the general introduction.
6267_65525_000004_000001.wav|It never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it.
6267_65525_000041_000000.wav|Any day, any hour, might bring john Lincoln to Plainfield.
6267_65525_000001_000007.wav|As she slipped into her blue print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below.
6267_65525_000012_000000.wav|Four years before, when Sidney was sixteen, still calling herself a schoolgirl by reason of the fact that she could be spared to attend school four months in the winter when work was slack, she had been much interested in the "Maple Leaf" department of the Montreal weekly her uncle took.
6267_65525_000027_000004.wav|She is to me mother and sister and wise, clear sighted friend.
6267_65525_000068_000001.wav|And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day, if you will let me.
6267_65525_000028_000004.wav|All the eastern Heaven was abloom with it.
6267_65525_000004_000000.wav|Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby.
6267_65525_000019_000000.wav|The very best letter I can write in the half hour before the carriage will be at the door to take me to mrs Braddon's dance shall be yours tonight.
6267_65525_000027_000006.wav|She has sympathy and understanding for my every mood.
6267_65525_000039_000001.wav|"Just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up.
6267_65525_000036_000002.wav|I shall go by the c p r, which passes through Plainfield, and I mean to stop off for a day.
6267_65525_000041_000004.wav|But he would find out the truth just the same; she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely.

6267_53049_000008_000001.wav|She wanted Penelope to go to that party.
6267_53049_000054_000002.wav|Isn't it all wonderful, Doris Hunter?"

6267_53049_000013_000000.wav|When Doris reached home the next evening, she found Penelope hovering over a bulky parcel on the sitting room table.
6267_53049_000007_000004.wav|Come now, Dorrie dear, smooth that pucker out.
6267_53049_000052_000000.wav|"You must take the place of my own dear little granddaughter," said Aunt esther.
6267_53049_000047_000007.wav|I have mine yet.
6267_53049_000026_000000.wav|"Why, the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right!" exclaimed Penelope.
6267_53049_000010_000002.wav|Indeed, she could not have done even that much if they had not owned their little cottage.
6267_53049_000041_000001.wav|Will you tell me where you got the silk of which your waist is made?"
6267_53049_000015_000001.wav|She knew that Penelope had started out to say "a new dress." She cut the strings and removed the wrappings.
6267_53049_000020_000005.wav|There is a bit of the wedding dress of every member of the family in it.
6267_53049_000035_000000.wav|"It will be such a nice surprise for her," the sister mused jubilantly.
6267_53049_000014_000003.wav|Hurry up and find out.
6267_53049_000050_000000.wav|"It sounds like a storybook," she said gaily.
6267_53049_000029_000003.wav|It is something to possess an heirloom, after all.
6267_53049_000011_000000.wav|"It is hard to be poor.
6267_53049_000026_000001.wav|"What lovely, old timey stuff!
6267_53049_000020_000004.wav|It took your grandmother five years to make it.
6267_53049_000048_000004.wav|I never knew what had become of Penelope.
6267_53049_000009_000000.wav|Penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasn't gone anywhere, thought the older sister wistfully.
6267_53049_000029_000004.wav|It gives one a nice, important family feeling."
6267_53049_000024_000000.wav|"Oh, very," agreed Penelope drolly.
6267_53049_000048_000001.wav|This was long ago, you know, when travelling and correspondence were not the easy, matter of course things they are now.
6267_53049_000017_000001.wav|She laughed a little shakily.
6267_53049_000016_000001.wav|Doris Hunter, I believe it's an old quilt!"
6267_53049_000047_000006.wav|Oddly enough, our birthdays fell on the same day, and when Penelope was twenty and I sixteen, my father gave us each a silk dress of this very material.
6267_53049_000027_000000.wav|The lining was certainly very pretty.
6267_53049_000048_000007.wav|You don't know how delighted I am to find that I have two grandnieces."
6267_53049_000048_000003.wav|I married out West and have lived there all my life.
6267_53049_000007_000000.wav|"Well, there is no use sitting here sighing for the unattainable," she said, jumping up briskly.
6267_53049_000047_000005.wav|Penelope was four years older than I was, but we were devoted to each other.
6267_53049_000050_000004.wav|I will tell you the whole truth-I don't mind it now.
6267_53049_000039_000001.wav|"I wish she belonged to me.
6267_53049_000009_000002.wav|If it could only be managed!
6267_53049_000057_000001.wav|"But it was very fortunate that you did it for once, sister mine.
6267_53049_000005_000001.wav|"If your black skirt were sponged and pressed and re hung, it would do very well."
6267_53049_000007_000003.wav|If I could only absorb algebra and history as I can music, what a blessing it would be!
6267_53049_000052_000001.wav|"She died six years ago, and I have been so lonely since."
6267_53049_000004_000000.wav|Penelope was seventeen, and when one is seventeen and cannot go to a party because one hasn't a suitable dress to wear, the world is very apt to seem a howling wilderness.
6267_53049_000051_000000.wav|mrs Fairweather did go to see Doris the very next day, and quite wonderful things came to pass from that interview.
6267_53049_000018_000001.wav|"Listen, Penelope."
6267_53049_000006_000001.wav|That pucker came often enough without being brought there by extra worries.
6267_53049_000038_000003.wav|Penelope thought her altogether charming.
6267_53049_000047_000004.wav|Penelope Saverne was the daughter of my mother by her first husband.
6267_53049_000007_000002.wav|It's a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher, isn't it?
6267_53049_000005_000000.wav|"I wish I could think of some way to get you a new waist," said Doris, with what these sisters called "the poverty pucker" coming in the centre of her pretty forehead.
6267_53049_000049_000001.wav|Now she patted mrs Fairweather's soft old hand affectionately.
6267_53049_000043_000000.wav|"My Aunt Adella gave me-gave us-the material," she stammered.
6267_53049_000009_000001.wav|She is getting discouraged over those examinations and she needs just a good, jolly time to hearten her up.
6267_53049_000045_000000.wav|"Penelope Saverne.
6267_53049_000014_000001.wav|"I really don't think my curiosity could have borne the strain for another five minutes.
6267_53049_000056_000001.wav|Music for you-somebody to pet and fuss over for me-and such a dear, sweet aunty for us both!"
6267_53049_000047_000002.wav|When I saw your dress, I felt sure you were related to her.
6267_53049_000022_000004.wav|Tell me, Dorrie, does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that I can't feel very enthusiastic over this heirloom-especially when Grandmother Hunter died years before I was born?"
6267_53049_000014_000002.wav|The expressman brought this parcel an hour ago, and there's a letter for you from Aunt Adella on the clock shelf, and I think they belong to each other.
6267_53049_000050_000001.wav|"You must come and see Doris.
6267_53049_000010_000000.wav|But Doris did not see how it could.
6267_53049_000040_000000.wav|A little later on the knowledge came to her suddenly, and she thought with inward surprise: Why, it is Doris, of course.
6267_53049_000051_000001.wav|Doris and Penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye.
6267_53049_000039_000000.wav|"She looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture," she said to herself.
6267_53049_000038_000001.wav|mrs Fairweather, who was visiting mrs Anderson, looked closely at it also.
6267_53049_000034_000001.wav|She thought it a wonderful bit of good luck that Penelope went out each of the evenings to study some especially difficult problems with a school chum.
6267_53049_000043_000002.wav|I think the silk once belonged to my Grandmother Hunter."
6267_53049_000050_000002.wav|She is such a darling sister.
6267_53049_000016_000000.wav|"Is it-it isn't-yes, it is!
6267_53049_000020_000001.wav|So I am disposing of such of the family heirlooms as I do not wish to take with me.
6267_53049_000022_000003.wav|The pattern is what they call 'Little Thousands,' isn't it?
6267_53049_000047_000000.wav|"Then you are my grandniece," she said.
6267_53049_000028_000003.wav|I declare, it is as good as new."
6267_53049_000012_000000.wav|Doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day.
8173_294714_000025_000004.wav|If he can pay a dividend to his creditors, they will give him his freedom; and he believes he can raise the money if I consent to insure my life."
8173_294714_000013_000000.wav|"How can you speak so cruelly to me?" she asked.
8173_294714_000026_000000.wav|To insure her life!
8173_294714_000020_000000.wav|"I hardly know how to tell you," she said, "without speaking again of mr Van Brandt."
8173_294714_000018_000000.wav|"Complete the good work that you have begun," she answered, gratefully. "Help me back to health.
8173_294714_000013_000006.wav|And you talk of my being your wife-knowing that!"
8173_294714_000015_000002.wav|A helpless woman, with a mock husband in prison for debt!
8173_294714_000036_000003.wav|It is only your goodness that overpowers me."
8173_294714_000019_000000.wav|"A doctor's estimate of your chances of living?" I repeated.
8173_294714_000037_000000.wav|I pressed her to my heart, with the unacknowledged tenderness of a parting embrace.
8173_294714_000013_000002.wav|What 'wrong' are you talking of?
8173_294714_000012_000000.wav|She put her hand on my mouth, and stopped me before I could say any more.
8173_294714_000016_000006.wav|I don't deny it; I don't excuse it-hopeless infatuation!
8173_294714_000017_000003.wav|You must have plans for the future; tell me unreservedly how I can help you."
8173_294714_000005_000000.wav|"My prospect of being married still rests with you."
8173_294714_000034_000000.wav|I could honestly promise that.
8173_294714_000023_000004.wav|There is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison.
8173_294714_000002_000000.wav|"You have said nothing to me about yourself," she began.
8173_294714_000034_000001.wav|My one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that I had now determined to pursue.
8173_294714_000014_000000.wav|"The child accepts me as her second father," I said.
8173_294714_000021_000001.wav|"Why need you hesitate?
8173_294714_000017_000002.wav|It is something to be your only friend.
8173_294714_000032_000000.wav|Cautiously as I had expressed myself, her delicacy took the alarm.
8173_294714_000027_000000.wav|In the eye of the law she was, of course, a single woman: she was of age; she was, to all intents and purposes, her own mistress.
8173_294714_000034_000002.wav|I rose to go, while my resolution still sustained me.
8173_294714_000017_000000.wav|"You have forgiven me," I said.
8173_294714_000013_000004.wav|Do you think I can ever forget the great misfortune of my life-the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you?
8173_294714_000025_000002.wav|Unhappily, he returned to tell me of his good fortune, and the same day he was arrested for debt.
8173_294714_000037_000002.wav|I had, so to speak, pronounced my own sentence of banishment.
8173_294714_000033_000000.wav|"Promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mr Van Brandt," she rejoined, "and I will accept your help gratefully."
8173_294714_000037_000005.wav|"For the last time!" I thought, as I held her to me for a moment longer-"for the last time!"
8173_294714_000016_000001.wav|Every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom I had loved, and lost.
8173_294714_000030_000000.wav|"I know nothing about it," she said, sadly.
8173_294714_000026_000001.wav|The snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words.
8173_294714_000021_000000.wav|"Does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts?" I asked.
8173_294714_000024_000000.wav|"Your help?" I exclaimed.
8173_294714_000018_000001.wav|Make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chances of living for some years yet."
8173_294714_000016_000005.wav|Hopeless infatuation!
8173_294714_000029_000000.wav|"You are quite mistaken," I replied.
8173_294714_000025_000000.wav|"Yes.
8173_294714_000027_000002.wav|Knowing what I knew of him-believing him, as I did, to be capable of any atrocity-I trembled at the bare idea of what might have happened if I had failed to find my way back to her until a later date. Thanks to the happy accident of my position, the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach.
8173_294714_000001_000000.wav|FEELING the embarrassment of the moment most painfully on her side, mrs Van Brandt spoke first.
8173_294714_000023_000002.wav|Never!
8173_294714_000015_000010.wav|The wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way.
8173_294714_000029_000002.wav|Are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance?"
8173_294714_000016_000000.wav|I yielded---and spoke of it no more.
8173_294714_000015_000000.wav|"Pride?" she repeated.
8173_294714_000010_000000.wav|Even this negative defense of Van Brandt stung me to the quick.
8173_294714_000029_000001.wav|"I am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mr Van Brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose.
8173_294714_000028_000001.wav|"I am very unfortunate; I seem to have innocently disturbed and annoyed you for the second time."
8173_294714_000000_000001.wav|LOVE AND MONEY.
8173_294714_000013_000003.wav|Is it the wrong I suffered when Van Brandt married me, with a wife living at the time (and living still)?
8173_294714_000015_000009.wav|The woman (in my situation) must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard of your friends!
8173_294714_000036_000001.wav|And don't mind my crying.
8173_294714_000035_000000.wav|She rose, as I rose-with the tears in her eyes, and the blush on her cheeks.
8173_294714_000006_000001.wav|"Don't spoil my pleasure in seeing you again by speaking of what can never be! Have you still to be told how it is that you find me here alone with my child?"
8173_294714_000022_000000.wav|She looked at me for a moment, in silent distress.
8173_294714_000031_000001.wav|They are trustworthy and experienced men, and I am sure they can be of use to you."
8173_294714_000036_000000.wav|"Kiss me," she whispered, "before you go!
8173_294714_000027_000001.wav|What was there to prevent her from insuring her life, if she pleased, and from so disposing of the insurance as to give Van Brandt a direct interest in her death?
8173_294714_000037_000003.wav|When my interference had restored my unworthy rival to his freedom, could I submit to the degrading necessity of seeing her in his presence, of speaking to her under his eyes?
8173_294714_000015_000008.wav|My only friend, is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife?
8173_294714_000006_000000.wav|"Don't say that!" she exclaimed, with an entreating look at me.
8173_294714_000031_000000.wav|"Will you let me ask the advice of my lawyers?
8173_294714_000037_000001.wav|It was impossible to disguise the position in which I had now placed myself.
8173_294714_000038_000002.wav|It was only when the child's round, innocent little face laid itself lovingly against mine that my fortitude gave way.
8173_294714_000011_000000.wav|"I ought to have spoken more guardedly of him," I said, bitterly.
8173_294714_000015_000004.wav|Am I to marry you for my food and shelter?
8173_294714_000013_000001.wav|"You know-to my shame I confessed it to you the last time we met-you know that my heart, in secret, is all yours.
8173_294714_000015_000001.wav|"In such a position as mine?
8173_294714_000017_000001.wav|"Let me deserve to be forgiven.
8173_294714_000004_000000.wav|"Is there any prospect of your being married?"
8173_294714_000023_000003.wav|Let me tell you the plain truth.
8173_294714_000038_000001.wav|My manhood had sustained me through the parting with the mother.
8173_294714_000023_000000.wav|"Oh! do you think I would let you give your money to Van Brandt?" she asked, as soon as she could speak.
8173_294714_000013_000005.wav|It is no fault of mine, God knows; but it is not the less true that I am not married, and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my child.
8173_294714_000009_000000.wav|"He left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested," she rejoined, sadly.
8173_294714_000003_000000.wav|"I cannot honestly say that it is," I answered.
8173_294714_000019_000001.wav|"What do you mean?"
8173_294714_000016_000004.wav|Bitterly as I hated the man who had parted us, I loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake.
8173_294714_000025_000001.wav|This is his position, in two words: A little while since, he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad, from a rich relative of his, and he had made all his arrangements to accept it.
8173_294714_000025_000003.wav|His relative has offered to keep the situation open for a certain time, and the time has not yet expired.
8173_294714_000002_000001.wav|"Is your life a happier one than it was when we last met?"
1585_131718_000007_000003.wav|In the second place, the coming of the incandescent light raised the standard of illumination in such a manner that more gas than ever was wanted in order to satisfy the popular demand for brightness and brilliancy both indoors and on the street.
1585_131718_000000_000000.wav|CHAPTER fifteen
1585_131718_000025_000009.wav|Edison marginalized documents extensively.
1585_131718_000005_000000.wav|It was not a fact at any time that the public was opposed to the idea of the electric light.
1585_131718_000015_000000.wav|For making the dynamos Edison secured, as noted in the preceding chapter, the Roach Iron Works on Goerck Street, New York, and this was also equipped.
1585_131718_000017_000001.wav|The routine was very much the same as that at the laboratory, in its utter neglect of the clock.
1585_131718_000012_000005.wav|They were not only more surly; they were diminishing the output, and it became impossible to manage the works.
1585_131718_000016_000010.wav|Finally I opened the pedestal-a storehouse for tools, etc
1585_131718_000017_000003.wav|The first year, eighteen eighty one, was naturally that which witnessed the greatest rush of visitors; and the building hardly ever closed its doors till midnight.
1585_131718_000009_000000.wav|So much for the early opposition, of which there was plenty.
1585_131718_000011_000010.wav|I still sold them for forty cents, and lost more money that year than any other, because the sales were increasing rapidly.
1585_131718_000033_000004.wav|The important question had arisen, therefore, of satisfying the fire underwriters as to the safety of the system.
1585_131718_000036_000008.wav|That made the Tammany man all safe.
1585_131718_000021_000006.wav|After that, every time he came to New York he used to call at 'sixty five' late at night with his violin.
1585_131718_000019_000008.wav|I thought no more about the matter.
1585_131718_000030_000004.wav|This was one of the big 'box houses' on upper Fifth Avenue.
1585_131718_000025_000001.wav|I did whatever he told me, and looked after all kinds of affairs, from buying his clothes to financing his business.
1585_131718_000026_000006.wav|I remember as a coincidence that the building was only twenty feet wide.
1585_131718_000030_000008.wav|mr Herter was doing the decoration, and it was extraordinarily fine.

1585_131718_000036_000010.wav|The other man could not, and so we let him out.
1585_131718_000028_000005.wav|As a matter of fact such work began in advance of almost every other kind.
1585_131718_000029_000002.wav|I had caused a printer's composing case to be set up with the idea that if we could get editors and publishers in to see it, we should show them the advantages of the electric light.
1585_131718_000021_000020.wav|I had nothing on to protect me against the cold.
1585_131718_000019_000005.wav|Even if I locked them up in my desk they would break it open.

1585_131718_000003_000003.wav|The way of the inventor is hard.
1585_131718_000012_000003.wav|He was discharged, whereupon the union notified us that unless the boy was taken back the whole body would go out.
1585_131718_000019_000011.wav|I was too busy on other things to notice."
1585_131718_000036_000003.wav|He gave us permission-told us to go ahead, and he would see it was all right.
1585_131718_000021_000018.wav|Speaking of telling stories, I once got telling a man stories at the Harrison lamp factory, in the yard, as he was leaving.
1585_131718_000021_000008.wav|I would talk for the benefit of his music.
1585_131718_000011_000006.wav|We sold them for forty cents; but there were only about twenty or thirty thousand of them.
1585_131718_000030_000007.wav|Twombly closed the contract with us for a plant.
1585_131718_000007_000001.wav|In two distinct directions the gas art was immediately helped by Edison's work.
1585_131718_000006_000001.wav|There also the most bitter feeling was shown.
1585_131718_000012_000007.wav|After feeling around for some days I got a clew how to do it.
1585_131718_000011_000004.wav|We moved the lamp works from Menlo Park to Harrison.
1585_131718_000016_000002.wav|This was one of the finest homes in the city of that period, and its acquisition was a premonitory sign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce.
1585_131718_000033_000016.wav|The process is heroic but costly.
1585_157660_000034_000000.wav|If he had dropped out of the clouds William could not have been more pleased or surprised, and the feeling was reciprocal.
1585_157660_000040_000000.wav|Quick as a flash William replied: "I know more than those who know less, and know less than those who know more."
1585_157660_000024_000000.wav|William, to the great amazement of the dealer, flung a guinea in the center pot, which was immediately tapped by Jack, while the others looked on in silent expectation.
1585_157660_000007_000000.wav|The Devil's Tavern was a resort for actors, authors, bohemians, lords and ladies, who did not retire early to their downy couches.
1585_157660_000029_000000.wav|William frantically said:
6841_88291_000013_000004.wav|The calf sprang up, was appropriated and smelled over by his worried mother, and the two departed into the herd to talk it over.
6841_88291_000022_000000.wav|And that went.
6841_88291_000005_000005.wav|I joined the Cattleman, and together we made our way afoot to the branding pen.
6841_88291_000012_000003.wav|In a brief moment it was over.
6841_88291_000009_000001.wav|The two "bull doggers" immediately pounced upon the victim.
6841_88291_000017_000004.wav|In such case he was generally snubbed up short enough at the end of the rope; but once or twice he succeeded in running around a group absorbed in branding.
6841_88291_000018_000001.wav|This is productive of some fun if it fails.
6841_88291_000008_000003.wav|This tightened the loop and prevented it from slipping off.
6841_88291_000017_000005.wav|You can imagine what happened next.
6841_88291_000007_000000.wav|In ten minutes Charley pronounced the irons ready.
6841_88291_000014_000001.wav|Undoubtedly it is to some extent painful, and could some other method of ready identification be devised, it might be as well to adopt it in preference.
6841_88291_000004_000002.wav|Before it moved silhouettes of men already eating.
6841_88291_000015_000002.wav|A calf usually bellows when the iron bites, but as soon as released he almost invariably goes to feeding or to looking idly about.
6841_88291_000017_000000.wav|Such good luck did not always follow, however.
6841_88291_000029_000001.wav|The total amounted to but an hundred and seventy five. Everybody went to searching for the missing bit.
6841_88291_000006_000000.wav|We were the only ones who did go afoot, however, although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards' distant.
6841_88291_000017_000001.wav|An occasional and exceedingly husky bull yearling declined to be upset in any such manner.
6841_88291_000029_000002.wav|It was not forth coming.
6841_88291_000027_000003.wav|Finally Homer rode over to the Cattleman and reported the branding finished.
6841_88291_000013_000000.wav|In the meantime the marker was engaged in his work.
6841_88291_000005_000000.wav|I piled out and joined the group.
6841_88291_000019_000004.wav|Men ran to and fro busy and intent.
6841_88291_000013_000001.wav|First, with a sharp knife he cut off slanting the upper quarter of one ear.
6841_88291_000021_000000.wav|"No more necked calves," they announced.
6841_88291_000016_000002.wav|And then, of course, there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehending excitement and the absolute matter of fact imperturbability of horse and rider.
6841_88291_000007_000002.wav|The rest of the men arose and stretched their legs and advanced.
6841_88291_000008_000009.wav|Behind him followed his anxious mother, her head swinging from side to side.
6841_88291_000027_000001.wav|Unbranded calves were scarce.
6841_88291_000024_000000.wav|Then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone.
6841_88291_000008_000002.wav|As the loop settled, he jerked sharply upward, exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish.
6841_88291_000010_000000.wav|"Hot iron!" yelled one of the bull doggers.
6841_88291_000008_000005.wav|Homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn, and sat over in one stirrup to avoid the tightened line and to preserve the balance.
6841_88291_000006_000001.wav|When we arrived we found the string of ponies standing around outside.
6841_88291_000012_000000.wav|Immediately two men ran forward.
6841_88291_000006_000004.wav|The three ropers sat their horses, idly swinging the loops of their ropes back and forth.
6841_88291_000025_000001.wav|"Would you like to have me tote it to you, or do you reckon you could toddle this far with yore little old iron?"
6841_88291_000004_000001.wav|A clear, licking little fire danced in the blackness.
6841_88291_000006_000002.wav|Between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle, and near the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence.
6841_88291_000005_000004.wav|The rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass.
6841_88291_000032_000002.wav|Therefore the noise was deafening, and the motion incessant.
6841_88291_000002_000001.wav|No dreams visited us, but in accordance with the immemorial habit of those who live out-whether in the woods, on the plains, among the mountains, or at sea-once during the night each of us rose on his elbow, looked about him, and dropped back to sleep.
6841_88291_000022_000002.wav|The bull doggers flatly refused to have anything to do with it. An obvious way out would have been to flip off the loop and try again; but of course that would have amounted to a confession of wrong.
6841_88291_000014_000005.wav|Imagine a puncher descending to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range or in a round up.
6841_88291_000006_000006.wav|One stood waiting for them to finish, a sheaf of long j h stamping irons in his hand.
6841_88291_000023_000000.wav|"You fellows drive me plumb weary," remarked the rider, slowly dismounting.
6841_88291_000015_000000.wav|But, as I have intimated, even the inevitable branding and ear marking are not so painful as one might suppose.
6841_88291_000027_000002.wav|Sometimes the men rode here and there for a minute or so before their eyes fell on a pair of uncropped ears.
6841_88291_000019_000003.wav|Rarely did the cast fail.
6841_88291_000009_000003.wav|One knelt on its head and twisted back its foreleg in a sort of hammer lock; the other seized one hind foot, pressed his boot heel against the other hind leg close to the body, and sat down behind the animal.
6841_88291_000002_000000.wav|All that night we slept like sticks of wood.
6841_88291_000009_000000.wav|Near the fire the horse stopped.
6841_88291_000022_000001.wav|Once in a while the rider, lazy, or careless, or bothered by the press of numbers, dragged up a victim caught by the neck.
6841_88291_000028_000000.wav|"One hundred and seventy six," he announced.
6841_88291_000019_000001.wav|The three horses came and went phlegmatically.
6841_88291_000009_000005.wav|When once you have had the wind knocked out of you, or a rib or two broken, you cease to think this unnecessarily rough.
6841_88291_000008_000007.wav|The critter had been caught by the two hind legs.
6841_88291_000031_000000.wav|This matter satisfactorily adjusted, the men all ran for their ponies. They had been doing a wrestler's heavy work all the morning, but did not seem to be tired.
6841_88291_000007_000001.wav|Homer, Wooden, and old California john rode in among the cattle.
6841_88291_000016_000001.wav|mr Frost's bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes.
6841_88291_000027_000000.wav|Toward noon the work slacked.
6841_88291_000004_000000.wav|Seemingly but a moment later the cook's howl brought me to consciousness again.
6841_88291_000009_000006.wav|Then one or the other threw off the rope. Homer rode away, coiling the rope as he went.
6841_88291_000019_000005.wav|Sometimes three or four calves were on the ground at once.
6841_88291_000015_000003.wav|Indeed, I have never seen one even take the trouble to lick his wounds, which is certainly not true in the case of the injuries they inflict on each other in fighting.
6841_88291_000008_000001.wav|In a moment Homer leaned forward and threw.
6841_88291_000023_000001.wav|"A little bit of a calf like that!
6841_88291_000026_000000.wav|But if the calf gave much trouble, then all work ceased while the unfortunate puncher wrestled it down.
6841_88291_000014_000004.wav|Inextinguishable laughter followed the spread of this doctrine through Arizona.
6841_88291_000029_000000.wav|The markers, squatted on their heels, told over the bits of ears they had saved.
6841_88291_000019_000002.wav|When the nooses fell, they turned and walked toward the fire as a matter of course.
6841_88291_000006_000008.wav|The first rays of the sun slanted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains.
6841_88291_000005_000002.wav|Three were to care for the remuda; five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed; three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before.
6841_88291_000017_000008.wav|Hot irons, hot language, and dust filled the air.
6841_88291_000025_000000.wav|"There's yore little calf," said he.
6841_88291_000012_000002.wav|A smoke and the smell of scorching hair arose. Perhaps the calf blatted a little as the heat scorched.
6841_88291_000014_000002.wav|But in the circumstance of a free range, thousands of cattle, and hundreds of owners, any other method is out of the question.
6841_88291_000011_000000.wav|"Marker!" yelled the other.
6841_88291_000009_000002.wav|It was promptly flopped over on its right side.
6841_88291_000005_000003.wav|That took up about half the men.
6841_88291_000012_000004.wav|The brand showed cherry, which is the proper colour to indicate due peeling and a successful mark.
6841_88291_000019_000000.wav|By now the branding was in full swing.
6841_88291_000012_000001.wav|The brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank.
6841_88291_000020_000000.wav|Toward the middle of the morning the bull doggers began to get a little tired.
6841_88291_000005_000001.wav|Homer was busy distributing his men for the day.
6841_88291_000019_000006.wav|Cries arose in a confusion: "Marker" "Hot iron!" "Tally one!" Dust eddied and dissipated.
6841_88291_000006_000007.wav|All the rest squatted on their heels along the fence, smoking cigarettes and chatting together.
6841_88291_000027_000004.wav|The latter counted the marks in his tally book.
6841_88291_000032_000000.wav|Through the wide gates the cattle were urged out to the open plain. There they were held for over an hour while the cows wandered about looking for their lost progeny.
6841_88291_000008_000006.wav|Nobody paid any attention to the calf.
6841_88294_000009_000004.wav|Or else he'd just talk.
6841_88294_000014_000000.wav|But he'd been too sick and too long abed.
6841_88294_000005_000000.wav|There was no doubt of his being alive, for he was breathing hard, like a man does when he gets hit over the head.
6841_88294_000032_000002.wav|Anyway, I thrust the muzzle of my Colt's into the sailor's face.
6841_88294_000013_000002.wav|He had me by the throat with his hand, and I felt the point of the hook pricking the back of my neck.
6841_88294_000009_000007.wav|He began when he was a kid, and he gave his side of conversations, pausing for replies.
6841_88294_000052_000000.wav|"Treasure," said he.
6841_88294_000066_000001.wav|"They'll be four of you to one of me; and I don't like it, and you can kiss the Book on that."
6841_88294_000013_000000.wav|I hadn't any more than got the words out of my mouth before he was atop me.
6841_88294_000015_000000.wav|In a minute or so he came to.
6841_88294_000023_000000.wav|"I've been robbed," he cried.
6841_88294_000031_000002.wav|On the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend. And that sharp hook was caught neatly under the point of the Mexican's jaw.
6841_88294_000004_000003.wav|Across his forehead ran a long gash, cutting his left eyebrow square in two.
6841_88294_000009_000008.wav|I could mighty near furnish the replies sometimes.
6841_88294_000065_000006.wav|This scheme did not appeal to him.
6841_88294_000062_000000.wav|"The devil's a preacher, if you ain't lost your pinfeathers,"' said he. "Well, it's this then: I got to have a boat to get there; and she must be stocked.
6841_88294_000047_000000.wav|I intended to take no more chances with that hook.
6841_88294_000064_000000.wav|"Why not?" he retorted.
6841_88294_000022_000000.wav|Just to satisfy him I passed over his old duds.
6841_88294_000065_000003.wav|He strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares, but I had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country.
6841_88294_000018_000002.wav|What do you think I'd want with them?
6841_88294_000003_000007.wav|This I had tangled up with and gotten well pricked.
6841_88294_000028_000002.wav|He nodded at me very sour, and dodged around the corner of the store.
6841_88294_000062_000001.wav|And I got to have help with the treasure, if it's like this fellow said it was.
6841_88294_000013_000003.wav|One little squeeze-Talk about your deadly weapons!
6841_88294_000048_000000.wav|He stood there looking straight at me without winking or offering to move.
6841_88294_000060_000001.wav|It's all very well to say gratitude, but that don't go with me.
6841_88294_000044_000001.wav|I saw him off and on.
6841_88294_000049_000000.wav|"What do you want?" I asked.
6841_88294_000027_000000.wav|He looked at me mighty suspicious, but didn't say anything more-he wouldn't even answer when I spoke to him.
6841_88294_000009_000002.wav|That was when he was best.
6841_88294_000025_000000.wav|"Where's my coat?" he asked.
6841_88294_000027_000002.wav|When I came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone.
6841_88294_000034_000001.wav|He was not the least bit afraid.
6841_88294_000009_000005.wav|That was the worst performance of all.
6841_88294_000004_000001.wav|He was a slim built young fellow, with straight black hair, long and lank and oily, a lean face, and big hooked nose.
6841_88294_000006_000003.wav|That brought him to.
6841_88294_000009_000000.wav|Well, he was clean out of his head for nigh two weeks.
6841_88294_000057_000001.wav|It will make us rich, and a dozen like us, and you can kiss the Book on that."
6841_88294_000054_000001.wav|He looked all right enough, neither drunk nor loco.
6841_88294_000021_000000.wav|"I know," he pleaded, "but let me see them."
6841_88294_000027_000001.wav|After he'd eaten a fair meal he fell asleep.
6841_88294_000003_000002.wav|At the same instant I heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg.
6841_88294_000006_000007.wav|It was another one further along, that went like this:
6841_88294_000041_000001.wav|I don't know whether he'd really won the coat at monte or not.
6841_88294_000044_000003.wav|However, I didn't pay much attention to that, being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games.
6841_88294_000028_000001.wav|Then I caught sight of him quite a ways off.
6841_88294_000039_000001.wav|In the half light I could see his face change.
6841_88294_000031_000000.wav|I ran up, pulling my gun.
6841_88294_000033_000000.wav|"What's this?" I asked.
6841_88294_000030_000000.wav|However, he didn't stay long in that frame of mind.
6841_88294_000026_000000.wav|"You had no coat when I picked you up," I replied.
6841_88294_000044_000000.wav|During the next two months he was a good deal about town, mostly doing odd jobs.
6841_88294_000016_000000.wav|"Now you're a nice, sweet proposition," said I, as soon as I was sure he could understand me.
6841_88294_000005_000002.wav|When a man breathes that way he's mostly all gone.
6841_88294_000060_000003.wav|It's a quality with a hell of a hang fire to it."
6841_88294_000065_000000.wav|We talked the matter over at length.
6841_88294_000065_000004.wav|Finally we compromised.
6841_88294_000067_000000.wav|"If you don't like it, leave it," said I, "and get out, and be damned to you."
6841_88294_000016_000001.wav|"Here I pick you up on the street and save your worthless carcass, and the first chance you get you try to crawl my hump.
6841_88294_000010_000003.wav|Usually I didn't bother with his talk, for it didn't mean anything, but something in his voice made me turn.
6841_88294_000004_000000.wav|I dragged him out into the light.
6841_88294_000010_000001.wav|I didn't pay any attention to him, for he was quiet.
6841_88294_000014_000002.wav|Then I put my six shooter on.
6841_88294_000059_000000.wav|"Why, mate," he answered, "it's just plain gratitude.
6841_88294_000006_000000.wav|Well, it was really none of my business, as you might say.
6841_88294_000013_000001.wav|His method was a winner.
6841_88294_000068_000000.wav|Finally he agreed; but he refused me a look at the chart, saying that he had left it in a safe place.
6841_88294_000063_000000.wav|"Why me?" I asked.
6841_88294_000010_000004.wav|He was lying on his side, those black eyes of his blazing at me, but now both of them saw the same distance.
6841_88294_000006_000005.wav|He sat up as though he'd been touched with a hot poker, stared around wild eyed, and cut loose with that song you were singing.
6841_88294_000020_000000.wav|"Now, look here," said I, "you can't get up to day.
6841_88294_000039_000003.wav|Without further delay he arose to his feet.
6841_88294_000035_000000.wav|"This man has my coat," he explained.
6841_88294_000018_000003.wav|They're safe enough."'
6841_88294_000003_000000.wav|We had every sort of people with us off and on, and, as I was lookout at a popular game, I saw them all.
6841_88294_000050_000000.wav|"I want to make up to you for your trouble," said he.
6841_88294_000066_000000.wav|"How do I know you plays fair?" he complained.
6841_88294_000062_000003.wav|It's money I got to have, and it's money I haven't got, and can't get unless I let somebody in as pardner."
6841_88294_000038_000000.wav|"Maybe," growled the sailor.
6841_88294_000006_000004.wav|Sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal, but it's no soothing syrup.
6841_88294_000062_000002.wav|And the Yaquis and cannibals from Tiburon is through the country.
6841_88294_000041_000002.wav|In any case, he flew poco pronto, leaving me and my friend together.
6841_88294_000009_000006.wav|It was like listening to one end of a telephone, though we didn't know what telephones were in those days.
6841_88294_000039_000002.wav|The gleam died from his eye; the snarl left his lips.
6841_88294_000046_000000.wav|"That's all right," said I, "but you better stay right there."
6841_88294_000009_000010.wav|But it was all little stuff.
6841_88294_000061_000000.wav|He looked at me sideways, spat, and looked at me sideways again.
6841_88294_000057_000000.wav|"And it's a big thing," said Handy Solomon to me, "for they's not only gold, but altar jewels and diamonds.
6841_88294_000003_000006.wav|In place of it he wore a sharp steel hook.
6841_88294_000010_000002.wav|As I was bending over the fire he spoke.
6841_88294_000003_000005.wav|Then I scouted to see what had cut me, and found that the fellow had lost a hand.
6841_88294_000018_000000.wav|"For heaven's sake," I yelled at him, "what's the matter with you and your old clothes?
6841_88294_000002_000000.wav|At this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness, leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the DRIP, DRIP, DRIP of eaves.
6841_88294_000058_000001.wav|Why don't you get your treasure without the need of dividing it?"
6841_88294_000060_000000.wav|"Look here, Anderson, or Handy Solomon, or whatever you please to call yourself," I rejoined to this, "if you're going to do business with me-and I do not understand yet just what it is you want of me-you'll have to talk straight.
6841_88294_000031_000003.wav|You bet he lay still.
6841_88294_000032_000000.wav|I really think I was just in time to save the man's life.
6841_88294_000043_000000.wav|This was in December.
6841_88294_000040_000000.wav|"Get up and give it here!" he demanded.
6841_88294_000065_000005.wav|A third of the treasure was to go to him, a third to me, and the rest was to be divided among the men whom I should select.
6841_88294_000037_000000.wav|"I ween heem at monte off Antonio Curvez," said he.
6841_88294_000017_000000.wav|"Where's my clothes?" he demanded again, very fierce.
6841_88294_000058_000000.wav|"That may all be true," said I, "but why do you tell me?
6841_88294_000020_000001.wav|You ain't fit."
1255_138279_000062_000000.wav|"No, not yet."
1255_138279_000064_000000.wav|"The fact is, I forgot to ask.
1255_138279_000009_000001.wav|Not long after a form moved by the brink of the river.
1255_138279_000005_000001.wav|Still, to a close observer, they are just as perceptible; the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well-known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf.
1255_138279_000013_000000.wav|Between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards.
1255_138279_000056_000000.wav|"Don't cry, now!
1255_138279_000025_000000.wav|"Fanny!" said the wall, in utter astonishment.
1255_138279_000055_000001.wav|Don't, dear Frank-will you-for I love you so.
1255_138279_000004_000000.wav|The scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river, behind which rose a high wall.
1255_138279_000023_000001.wav|"What girl are you?"
1255_138279_000033_000000.wav|"Yes, I mean that I might.
1255_138279_000002_000000.wav|For dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a certain town and military station, many miles north of Weatherbury, at a later hour on this same snowy evening-if that may be called a prospect of which the chief constituent was darkness.
1255_138279_000044_000000.wav|"I don't quite recollect."
1255_138279_000060_000001.wav|We'll settle in a few days."
1255_138279_000068_000000.wav|And the noise was again heard of a window closing.
1255_138279_000014_000000.wav|Here the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller.
1255_138279_000032_000000.wav|"Well-I said that you might."
1255_138279_000049_000001.wav|Will it be by banns or license?"
1255_138279_000036_000002.wav|We are all of us as good as in the county gaol till to morrow morning."
1255_138279_000056_000001.wav|It is foolish.
1255_138279_000014_000004.wav|The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman.
1255_138279_000024_000000.wav|"Oh, Frank-don't you know me?" said the spot.
1255_138279_000014_000002.wav|Then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window.
1255_138279_000008_000001.wav|It was a neighbouring clock striking ten.
1255_138279_000010_000000.wav|By its outline upon the colourless background, a close observer might have seen that it was small.
1255_138279_000019_000000.wav|"Who's there?"
1255_138279_000037_000000.wav|"Then I shan't see you till then!"
1255_138279_000065_000005.wav|There are bad women about, and they think me one."
1255_138279_000022_000000.wav|This person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth, and the other speaker so much a part of the building, that one would have said the wall was holding a conversation with the snow.
1255_138279_000060_000000.wav|"Not to morrow.
1255_138279_000020_000000.wav|The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.
1255_138279_000054_000000.wav|"Is that the law?"
1255_138279_000001_000000.wav|OUTSIDE THE BARRACKS-SNOW-A MEETING
1255_138279_000049_000000.wav|"I have money.
1255_138279_000028_000000.wav|"How did you come here?"
1255_138279_000051_000000.wav|"And we live in two parishes."
1255_138279_000003_000000.wav|It was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love becomes solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope: when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.
1255_138279_000052_000001.wav|What then?"
1255_138279_000045_000001.wav|Don't speak like that.
1255_138279_000007_000003.wav|Below, down to the water's edge, the flat was unbroken by hole or projection.
1255_138279_000030_000003.wav|I am orderly to morrow."
1255_138279_000008_000002.wav|The bell was in the open air, and being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow, had lost its voice for the time.
1255_138279_000029_000001.wav|Forgive me!"
1255_138279_000050_000000.wav|"Banns, I should think."
1255_138279_000045_000000.wav|"O you do!
1255_138279_000048_000001.wav|Well-you have to get proper clothes."
1255_138279_000007_000002.wav|The indistinct summit of the facade was notched and pronged by chimneys here and there, and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes of windows, though only in the upper part.
1255_138279_000011_000001.wav|At this time some words were spoken aloud:--
1255_138279_000059_000000.wav|"To morrow?"
1255_138279_000067_000000.wav|"Good night, Frank-good night!"
1255_138279_000038_000000.wav|"How did you get here from Weatherbury?"
1255_138279_000008_000000.wav|An indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing in their regularity, sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere.
1255_138279_000065_000002.wav|I'll go away now.
1255_138279_000023_000000.wav|"Yes," came suspiciously from the shadow.
1255_138279_000006_000000.wav|This climax of the series had been reached to night on the aforesaid moor, and for the first time in the season its irregularities were forms without features; suggestive of anything, proclaiming nothing, and without more character than that of being the limit of something else-the lowest layer of a firmament of snow.
1255_138279_000045_000002.wav|It weighs me to the earth.
1255_138279_000047_000000.wav|"O, must I?--it is, when shall we be married, Frank?"
1255_138279_000043_000000.wav|"That you promised."
1255_138279_000030_000001.wav|Indeed, I did not think you would come at all.
1255_138279_000014_000003.wav|It smacked against the wall at a point several yards from its mark.
1255_138279_000030_000000.wav|"I did not expect you to night.
1255_138279_000036_000000.wav|My dear Fan, no!
1255_138279_000026_000000.wav|"Yes," said the girl, with a half suppressed gasp of emotion.
1255_138279_000036_000001.wav|The bugle has sounded, the barrack gates are closed, and I have no leave.
1255_138279_000056_000002.wav|If I said so, of course I will."
1255_138279_000041_000000.wav|"Yes-so am i And Frank, when will it be?"
1255_138279_000045_000003.wav|It makes me say what ought to be said first by you."
1255_138279_000011_000000.wav|The shape went slowly along, but without much exertion, for the snow, though sudden, was not as yet more than two inches deep.
1255_138279_000058_000000.wav|"Yes"
1255_138279_000068_000001.wav|The little spot moved away.
1255_138279_000029_000000.wav|"I asked which was your window.
1255_138279_000063_000001.wav|You said you almost had before you left Casterbridge."
1255_138279_000021_000000.wav|"Is it Sergeant Troy?" said the blurred spot in the snow, tremulously.
1255_138279_000004_000001.wav|On the right was a tract of land, partly meadow and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a wide undulating upland.
1255_138279_000061_000000.wav|"You have the permission of the officers?"
1255_138279_000040_000000.wav|"I am surprised."
1255_138279_000065_000000.wav|"Yes-yes-it is.
1255_138279_000066_000002.wav|Good night."
1255_138279_000065_000004.wav|I don't like to come to the Barracks.
1255_138279_000018_000001.wav|This was followed by a voice from the same quarter.
1255_138279_000035_000000.wav|"Can you-come to me!"
1255_138279_000024_000001.wav|"Your wife, Fanny Robin."
1255_138279_000031_000000.wav|"You said I was to come."
1255_138279_000005_000002.wav|Many are not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor or waste.
1255_138279_000010_000001.wav|This was all that was positively discoverable, though it seemed human.
1255_138279_000039_000000.wav|"I walked-some part of the way-the rest by the carriers."
1255_138279_000016_000000.wav|The river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision, any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool.
1255_138279_000034_000000.wav|"Oh yes-of course."
1255_138279_000046_000000.wav|"Never mind-say it."
1255_90407_000021_000000.wav|'My father,' she burst out suddenly, 'is always scolding me for my extravagance!
1255_90407_000015_000000.wav|'He's my father!'
1255_90407_000016_000000.wav|'Indeed.
1255_90407_000007_000000.wav|'Never!' said she, and the firmness with which she closed her lips was audible in the word.
1255_90407_000016_000001.wav|I am sorry I should have spoken so disrespectfully of him, for I never knew him personally.
1255_90407_000005_000000.wav|She replied nothing to this, and he added that it was rather a desolate place for a woman, alone and afoot.
1255_90407_000040_000002.wav|Their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt, and they stood within the gaslight of the passage.
1255_90407_000038_000000.wav|Somewhere about this time-it might have been sooner, it might have been later-he became conscious of a sensation which, in its incipient and unrecognized form, had lurked within him from some unnoticed moment when he was sitting close to his new friend under the lerret.
1255_90407_000005_000001.wav|He hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time.
1255_90407_000021_000001.wav|And he has been doing it to day more than ever.
1255_90407_000044_000001.wav|By the aid of some temporary wraps, and some slippers from the cupboard, he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maid servant came downstairs with a damp armful of woman's raiment.
1255_90407_000033_000002.wav|I cannot leave you.
1255_90407_000035_000000.wav|They had not realized the force of the elements till now.
1255_90407_000049_000004.wav|The Well Beloved was moving house-had gone over to the wearer of this attire.
1255_90407_000042_000001.wav|I will tell the servant to do this, and send you up something to eat.'
1255_90407_000037_000000.wav|Her clothing offered more resistance to the wind than his, and she was consequently in the greater danger.
1255_90407_000037_000002.wav|First he gave his arm, but the wind tore them apart as easily as coupled cherries.
1255_90407_000051_000001.wav|He did not think of her as before.
1255_90407_000017_000003.wav|But we have been tenants of Sylvania Castle, on the island here, this season.
1255_90407_000017_000000.wav|'Yes.
1255_90407_000002_000001.wav|Neither had spoken since they left the roadway till she said, with attempted unconcern: 'This is unfortunate.'
1255_90407_000018_000000.wav|'Then I have been staying quite near you, Miss Bencomb.
1255_90407_000049_000000.wav|The 'night porter' thanked him and left the room, and he soon heard her snoring from the adjoining apartment.
1255_90407_000003_000000.wav|He admitted that it was, and found, after a few further remarks had passed, that she certainly had been weeping, there being a suppressed gasp of passionateness in her utterance now and then.
1255_90407_000049_000003.wav|He again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk.
1255_90407_000013_000002.wav|Haven't you heard of the Best Bed Stone Company?'
1255_90407_000030_000000.wav|'Rain or no rain, I can stay no longer,' she said.
1255_90407_000052_000001.wav|But, loving her or not, he perceived that the spirit, emanation, idealism, which called itself his Love was flitting stealthily from some remoter figure to the near one in the chamber overhead.
1255_90407_000040_000000.wav|He pitied her, and, while he wondered at it, admired her determination. The houses facing the bay now sheltered them completely, and they reached the vicinity of the new railway terminus (which the station was at this date) without difficulty.
1255_90407_000019_000000.wav|'But he could afford a much bigger one if he chose.'
1255_90407_000027_000000.wav|'I must sit here till it stops.'
1255_90407_000046_000000.wav|'You are sleepy, my girl,' said Pierston.
1255_90407_000034_000001.wav|Nothing but the frail bank of pebbles divided them from the raging gulf without, and at every bang of the tide against it the ground shook, the shingle clashed, the spray rose vertically, and was blown over their heads.
1255_90407_000017_000002.wav|We have lived there for years.
1255_90407_000039_000002.wav|Into it they plodded without pause, crossing the harbour bridge about midnight, wet to the skin.
1255_90407_000006_000001.wav|But, as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation, he observed: 'I think we shall have to go back.'
1255_90407_000039_000001.wav|They passed the ruined castle, and having left the island far behind them trod mile after mile till they drew near to the outskirts of the neighbouring watering place.

1255_90407_000045_000001.wav|The maid servant knelt down before the blaze and held up with extended arms one of the habiliments of the Juno upstairs, from which a cloud of steam began to rise.
1255_90407_000017_000001.wav|Our house, or rather his, not mine, is at South Kensington.
1255_90407_000001_000000.wav|The rain fell upon the keel of the old lerret like corn thrown in handfuls by some colossal sower, and darkness set in to its full shade.
1255_90407_000011_000000.wav|'Oh, but you know me-about me, at least.'
1255_90407_000020_000001.wav|I don't know.
1255_90407_000018_000001.wav|My father's is a comparatively humble residence hard by.'
1255_90407_000012_000001.wav|How should I? You are a kimberlin.'
1255_90407_000053_000000.wav|Avice had not kept her engagement to meet him in the lonely ruin, fearing her own imaginings.
1255_90407_000034_000002.wav|Quantities of sea water trickled through the pebble wall, and ran in rivulets across their path to join the sea within.
1255_90407_000033_000003.wav|It would be too awkward for you to go there alone.'
1255_90407_000025_000001.wav|I have left my father for ever!
1255_90407_000045_000000.wav|Pierston withdrew from the fire.
1255_90407_000009_000000.wav|'There are good reasons.'
1255_90407_000004_000000.wav|'It is more unfortunate for you, perhaps, than for me,' he said, 'and I am very sorry that it should be so.'
1255_90407_000008_000000.wav|'Why not?' he inquired.
1255_90407_000031_000001.wav|'I'll return with you.
1255_90407_000013_000001.wav|I am a real islander-or was, rather....
1255_90407_000031_000000.wav|'Do come back,' said he, taking her hand.
1255_90407_000048_000001.wav|I'll dry the clothing and put the articles here in a heap, which you can take up to the young lady in the morning.'
1255_90407_000042_000000.wav|She persisted in the determination to go on to London by an early morning train, and he therefore offered advice on lesser matters only. 'In that case,' he said, 'you must go up to your room and send down your things, that they may be dried by the fire immediately, or they will not be ready.
1255_90407_000031_000002.wav|My train has gone.'
1255_90407_000013_000000.wav|'I am not.
1255_90407_000026_000000.wav|'If you ever do in this hurricane.'
1255_90407_000033_000001.wav|However, if you are determined I will show you the way.
1255_90407_000014_000000.wav|'I should think so!
1255_90407_000016_000002.wav|After making over his large business to the company, he retired, I believe, to London?'
1255_90407_000020_000002.wav|He doesn't tell me much of his affairs.'
1255_90407_000038_000002.wav|It meant a possible migration of the Well Beloved.
1255_90407_000043_000001.wav|He felt ravenously hungry himself, and set about drying his clothes as well as he could, and eating at the same time.
1255_90407_000006_000000.wav|At first she seemed not at all disposed to show any candour on her own affairs, and he was left to conjecture as to her history and name, and how she could possibly have known him.
1255_90407_000036_000000.wav|'The ethereal substance closed, Not long divisible.'
1255_90407_000049_000001.wav|Then Jocelyn opened proceedings, overhauling the robes and extending them one by one.
1255_90407_000034_000003.wav|The 'Island' was an island still.
1255_90407_000028_000002.wav|Jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the Montagues to this daughter of the Capulets.
1255_90407_000022_000000.wav|'Was that this evening?'
1255_90407_000038_000003.wav|The thing had not, however, taken place; and he went on thinking how soft and warm the lady was in her fur covering, as he held her so tightly; the only dry spots in the clothing of either being her left side and his right, where they excluded the rain by their mutual pressure.
1255_90407_000025_000003.wav|Now I shall take the train as soon as I reach the mainland.'
1255_90413_000002_000001.wav|Afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for form's sake; but eventually gravitated together again, and finished the evening in each other's company.
1255_90413_000015_000000.wav|'You would find this is often done, with excellent effect.'
1255_90413_000004_000001.wav|He was now over forty, she was probably thirty; and he dared not make unmeaning love with the careless selfishness of a younger man.
1255_90413_000029_000000.wav|But Jocelyn was receding from the pretty widow's house with long strides.
1255_90413_000024_000001.wav|I saw him at Lady Channelcliffe's the other night.'
1255_90413_000005_000000.wav|He determined to call immediately on the New Incarnation.
1255_90413_000006_000001.wav|But somehow the very bell pull seemed cold, although she had so earnestly asked him to come.
1255_90413_000032_000001.wav|She looked very charming between the candles, and then suddenly it dawned upon him that her previous manner must have originated in some false report about Marcia, of whose existence he had not heard for years.
1255_90413_000017_000000.wav|'Yes; I have had my house some years,' she observed complacently, 'and I like it better every year.'
1255_90413_000032_000002.wav|Anyhow, he was not disposed to resent an inexplicability in womankind, having found that it usually arose independently of fact, reason, probability, or his own deserts.
1255_90413_000032_000000.wav|He had not been appointed to take her across to the dining room, but at the table found her exactly opposite.
1255_90413_000012_000000.wav|'Indeed!'
1255_90413_000022_000000.wav|'It is rather uncivil.
1255_90413_000007_000000.wav|As the house spoke, so spoke the occupant, much to the astonishment of the sculptor.
1255_90413_000036_000001.wav|But the end of the letter was what arrested him-
1255_90413_000022_000001.wav|Good bye,' said Pierston.
1255_90413_000025_000000.wav|'Jocelyn Pierston.'
1255_90413_000008_000002.wav|But happily his affection was incipient as yet, and a sudden sense of the ridiculous in his own position carried him to the verge of risibility during the scene.
1255_90413_000002_000003.wav|But this was not all.
1255_90413_000014_000000.wav|'Yes?'
1255_90413_000009_000000.wav|They talked over the day's news, and then an organ began to grind outside.
1255_90413_000002_000005.wav|She was, in a word, willing to go on.
1255_90413_000023_000001.wav|'Now what the devil this means I cannot tell,' he said to himself, reflecting stock still for a moment on the stairs.
1255_90413_000020_000002.wav|'No: I shall not care to come again,' he answered, in a tone inaudible to the young ladies.
1255_90413_000033_000000.wav|So he dined on, catching her eyes and the few pretty words she made opportunity to project across the table to him now and then.
1255_90413_000021_000001.wav|'What an uncivil thing to say!' she murmured in surprise.
1255_90413_000019_000000.wav|'O never!'
1255_90413_000008_000003.wav|She signified a chair, and began the critical study of some rings she wore.
1255_90413_000018_000000.wav|'Don't you feel lonely in it sometimes?'
1255_90413_000023_000002.wav|And yet the meaning was staring him in the face.
1255_90413_000035_000001.wav|The spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved.
1255_90413_000030_000002.wav|She had been the first arrival.
1255_90413_000021_000000.wav|She followed him to the door.
1255_90413_000034_000002.wav|Having hardly a correspondent in that part of the world now he began to conjecture on the possible sender.
1255_90413_000029_000001.wav|He went out very little during the next few days, but about a week later he kept an engagement to dine with Lady Iris Speedwell, whom he never neglected, because she was the brightest hostess in London.
1255_90413_000020_000001.wav|She asked him to come again; and he thought he would tell the truth.
1255_90413_000031_000001.wav|As the other guests dropped in, the pair retreated into a shady corner, and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking.
1255_90413_000024_000000.wav|Meanwhile one of the three young ladies had said, 'What interesting man was that, with his lovely head of hair?
1255_90413_000001_000001.wav|He had his doubts.
1255_90413_000037_000000.wav|'You will be sorry to hear, Sir, that dear little Avice Caro, as we used to call her in her maiden days, is dead.
1255_90413_000033_000001.wav|He was courteously responsive only, but mrs Pine Avon herself distinctly made advances.
1255_90413_000028_000001.wav|'How I wish I could run after him!'
1255_90413_000000_000002.wav|How that chestnut hair of hers had shone: it required no tiara to set it off, like that of the dowager he had seen there, who had put ten thousand pounds upon her head to make herself look worse than she would have appeared with the ninepenny muslin cap of a servant woman.
1255_90413_000002_000002.wav|When, shortly after eleven, he came away, he felt almost certain that within those luminous grey eyes the One of his eternal fidelity had verily taken lodgings-and for a long lease.
1255_90413_000007_000002.wav|To be sure it was mrs Nichola Pine Avon, but frosted over indescribably.
1255_90413_000034_000001.wav|Pierston drew it sufficiently forth to observe by the post mark that it came from his natal isle.
1255_90413_000027_000000.wav|'O! didn't he marry her?' said mrs Pine Avon, with a start.
1255_90413_000011_000000.wav|'Now, I'll tell you all about it,' said he gravely.
1255_90413_000035_000003.wav|The lady on Jocelyn's left, wife of a Lord Justice of Appeal, was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side; so that, for the time, he was left to himself.
1255_90413_000004_000002.wav|It was unfair to go further without telling her, even though, hitherto, such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded.
1255_90413_000000_000001.wav|They were round, inquiring, luminous.
1255_90413_000003_000000.wav|But was he able?
1255_90413_000011_000001.wav|'It is based on a sound old melody called "The Jilt's Hornpipe." Just as they turn Madeira into port in the space of a single night, so this old air has been taken and doctored, and twisted about, and brought out as a new popular ditty.'
1255_90413_000008_000001.wav|He had distinctly begun to love Nichola, and he felt sick and almost resentful.
1255_74899_000003_000001.wav|The Countess disapproves altogether of the marriage which is about to take place between Lady Anna Lovel and mr Daniel Thwaite, and will take no part in the ceremony."
1255_74899_000009_000003.wav|We are made of different fabric,--though the stuff was originally the same.
1255_74899_000023_000000.wav|"As when one man throws away forty thousand a year on race courses."
1255_74899_000021_000000.wav|"The grandest thing in the world, Sir William."
1255_74899_000029_000002.wav|On the following day, Lady Anna was with him as usual; for the pretext of his wound still afforded to her the means of paying to him those daily visits which in happier circumstances he would naturally have paid to her.
1255_74899_000001_000000.wav|THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES.
1255_74899_000012_000001.wav|"They were poles asunder, if you will. But by your good fortune and merit, if you will allow me to say so, you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other."
1255_74899_000024_000001.wav|When two men run a race, some strength must be wasted in fruitless steps beyond the goal.
1255_74899_000047_000001.wav|She was much obliged, she said, to the rector for his goodness in promising to marry them; and as she had no friends of her own she hoped that Minnie Lovel would be her bridesmaid.
1255_74899_000029_000008.wav|"If you really wish it, you shall go," he said.
1255_74899_000033_000001.wav|Must I have a pink silk gown to walk about in, early in the morning?"
1255_74899_000029_000003.wav|"Would you like to go to Yoxham?" he said.
1255_74899_000024_000000.wav|"When you make much water boil, mr Thwaite, some of it will probably boil over.
1255_74899_000043_000000.wav|MY DEAR LORD,
1255_74899_000029_000004.wav|She looked wistfully up into his face.
1255_74899_000012_000000.wav|"Not so," replied Sir William.
1255_74899_000045_000000.wav|With all sincerity, Your lordship's very obedient servant,
1255_74899_000030_000000.wav|"But you must go also."
1255_74899_000020_000004.wav|Would you not desire wealth in order that you might be assisted by it in your views of ambition?
1255_74899_000009_000000.wav|"No one should,--unless I be mean and despicable.
1255_74899_000020_000003.wav|If you were a master tradesman, would you not wish to lead and guide your brother tradesmen?
1255_74899_000005_000000.wav|This reply was received at Yoxham three days before any answer came either from Lady Anna or from the tailor.
1255_74899_000040_000000.wav|"I won't be ashamed of you.
1255_74899_000006_000000.wav|"They are cousins, you know," said Lady Anna.
1255_74899_000006_000001.wav|"And there was a little girl there I loved so much."
1255_74899_000010_000000.wav|"I don't see why you shouldn't hold up your head with any man in England," said Lady Anna.
1255_74899_000036_000000.wav|"I can do that too."
1255_74899_000040_000004.wav|What does it all signify, if you are not happy?"
1255_74899_000011_000004.wav|It was a matter that required to be considered.
1255_74899_000031_000001.wav|And I must have a pair of gloves and a black coat."
1255_74899_000038_000000.wav|"The tailor must behave himself properly," said Lady Anna.
1255_74899_000046_000000.wav|DANIEL THWAITE.
1255_74899_000009_000001.wav|But they do,--you may be sure.
1255_74899_000028_000000.wav|"I quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders," and so the conversation was ended.
1255_74899_000027_000001.wav|But you can't make me like a lord, or think that a young man ought to wear a silk gown."
1255_74899_000009_000006.wav|I should not know how to drink wine with them, and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast."
1255_74899_000032_000000.wav|"And a blue one,--to be married in."
1255_74899_000007_000000.wav|"They can't but despise me, you know," said the tailor.
1255_74899_000022_000000.wav|"It is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend.

1255_74899_000009_000002.wav|It is only human nature that they should.
1255_74899_000017_000000.wav|"Why should the children of lords be such to the tenth and twentieth generation?"
1255_74899_000031_000000.wav|"Yes;--for one day.
1255_74899_000044_000002.wav|Not the less do I feel your courtesy, and I am,
1255_74899_000011_000009.wav|But if the cousins were willing to accept her husband, why should he not be willing to be accepted?
1255_74899_000029_000005.wav|With her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband.
1255_74899_000042_000000.wav|Two letters were written accepting the invitation.
1255_74899_000024_000003.wav|The subject is so large that I should like to discuss it with you when we have more time.
1255_74899_000020_000009.wav|The theory of equality is very grand."
1255_74899_000027_000000.wav|"I cannot, and so you have the best of me.
1255_74899_000002_000000.wav|But the Countess never gave way an inch.
1255_74899_000039_000001.wav|I know you'll be ashamed of me, and then we shall both be unhappy."
1255_74899_000020_000001.wav|When you were a workman among workmen, did you not wish to be their leader?
1255_74899_000041_000000.wav|"I will go," said he.
1255_74899_000011_000010.wav|Pride in him might be as weak as pride in them.
1255_74899_000020_000002.wav|When you were foremost among them, did you not wish to be their master?
1255_74899_000003_000000.wav|"The Countess Lovel presents her compliments to Miss Lovel.
1255_74899_000040_000001.wav|I will never be ashamed of you.
1255_74899_000011_000006.wav|The husband should be to her in all respects the first and foremost.
1255_74899_000011_000011.wav|If they would put out their hands to him, why should he refuse to put out his own?
1255_74899_000034_000000.wav|"You shall if you like, and I'll make it for you."
1255_74899_000022_000002.wav|But could you establish absolute equality in England to morrow, as it was to have been established in France some half century ago, the inequality of men's minds and character would re-establish an aristocracy within twenty years.
1255_74899_000040_000002.wav|I will be ashamed of them if they are not good to you.
1255_74899_000011_000000.wav|"And so I ought;--but I shouldn't.
700_122867_000031_000000.wav|Accordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red.
700_122867_000033_000001.wav|During that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day.
700_122867_000040_000003.wav|And I won't try to imagine it away, either.
700_122867_000043_000002.wav|I'll have to see a doctor about them.
700_122867_000013_000002.wav|Get right up this minute and tell me.
700_122867_000042_000004.wav|It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn't it?
700_122867_000032_000001.wav|"I can never live this down.
700_122867_000012_000001.wav|But please, Marilla, go away and don't look at me.
700_122867_000043_000001.wav|It was terrible bad this afternoon, though. These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse.
700_122867_000032_000003.wav|But they'll never forget this.
700_122867_000003_000000.wav|Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and irritated.
700_122867_000033_000003.wav|At the end of the week Marilla said decidedly:
700_122867_000030_000001.wav|Goodness knows what's to be done.
700_122867_000029_000007.wav|In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible.
700_122867_000017_000001.wav|Why, it's GREEN!"
700_122867_000006_000003.wav|But I'm bringing her up, not you."
700_122867_000025_000005.wav|I have proof now-green hair is proof enough for anybody.
700_122867_000029_000012.wav|And I've been repenting ever since."
700_122867_000027_000000.wav|"The peddler that was here this afternoon.
700_122867_000042_000000.wav|"I didn't say anything when Josie said that to me," Anne confided that evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches, "because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it patiently.
700_122867_000034_000002.wav|Your hair must be cut off; there is no other way.
700_122867_000032_000006.wav|And oh, how Josie Pye will laugh!
700_122867_000032_000000.wav|"Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?" questioned Anne in tears.
700_122867_000004_000013.wav|I must say, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I'm real sorry to find her so now."
700_122867_000007_000001.wav|Marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly.
700_122867_000028_000001.wav|I don't believe in encouraging them to come around at all."
700_122867_000042_000013.wav|Does it hurt your head?"
700_122867_000029_000011.wav|I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you.
700_122867_000029_000005.wav|Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye.
700_122867_000019_000001.wav|"I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair.
700_122867_000038_000000.wav|"I'll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows," she exclaimed passionately.
700_122867_000013_000004.wav|There now, what is it?"
700_122867_000036_000004.wav|But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there?
700_122867_000006_000000.wav|"She's not here when I told her to stay," retorted Marilla.
700_122867_000042_000005.wav|I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again.
700_122867_000006_000001.wav|"I reckon she'll find it hard to explain THAT to my satisfaction.
700_122867_000004_000011.wav|But I'm bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who'd pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea.
700_122867_000035_000000.wav|Anne's lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of Marilla's remarks.
700_122867_000012_000004.wav|My career is closed.
700_122867_000000_000000.wav|CHAPTER twenty seven.
700_122867_000042_000006.wav|Of course it's better to be good.
700_122867_000013_000001.wav|What have you done?
700_122867_000016_000001.wav|It certainly had a very strange appearance.
700_122867_000007_000003.wav|Lighting it, she turned around to see Anne herself lying on the bed, face downward among the pillows.
700_122867_000026_000000.wav|"Who said?
700_122867_000029_000006.wav|The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn't wash off.
700_122867_000029_000004.wav|I wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object.
700_122867_000001_000003.wav|The spring was abroad in the land and Marilla's sober, middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness.
700_122867_000012_000005.wav|Please, Marilla, go away and don't look at me."
700_122867_000036_000005.wav|I'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off, if it won't interfere.
700_122867_000012_000002.wav|I'm in the depths of despair and I don't care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday school choir any more.
700_122867_000025_000002.wav|How could I doubt his word, Marilla?
700_122867_000004_000000.wav|"I'll settle Miss Anne when she comes home," said Marilla grimly, as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary.
700_122867_000004_000007.wav|But there!
700_122867_000032_000007.wav|Marilla, I CANNOT face Josie Pye.
700_122867_000041_000000.wav|Anne's clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday, but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie Pye, who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow.
700_122867_000020_000001.wav|"Come right down to the kitchen-it's too cold up here-and tell me just what you've done.
700_122867_000009_000000.wav|"No," was the muffled reply.
700_122867_000024_000001.wav|I wouldn't have dyed it green."
700_122867_000006_000002.wav|Of course I knew you'd take her part, matthew.
700_122867_000029_000000.wav|"Oh, I didn't let him in the house.
700_122867_000037_000001.wav|Marilla had done her work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible. The result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be.
700_122867_000036_000001.wav|Oh, I feel that my heart is broken.
700_122867_000022_000001.wav|Dyed your hair!
700_122867_000040_000000.wav|"Yes, I will, too.
700_122867_000032_000005.wav|Oh, Marilla, 'what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.' That is poetry, but it is true.
700_122867_000036_000002.wav|This is such an unromantic affliction.
700_122867_000007_000000.wav|It was dark when supper was ready, and still no sign of Anne, coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover's Lane, breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties.
700_122867_000032_000008.wav|I am the unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island."
700_122867_000032_000002.wav|People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes-the liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with mrs Lynde.
700_122867_000021_000000.wav|"I dyed it."
700_122867_000004_000004.wav|I don't care if mrs Allan does say she's the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew.
700_122867_000019_000003.wav|Oh, Marilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am."
700_122867_000015_000000.wav|"Look at my hair, Marilla," she whispered.
700_122867_000020_000004.wav|Now, then, what did you do to your hair?"
700_122867_000022_000000.wav|"Dyed it!
700_122867_000023_000003.wav|Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it."
700_122867_000023_000002.wav|I counted the cost, Marilla.
700_122867_000012_000000.wav|"no
700_122867_000043_000000.wav|"My head is better now.
700_122867_000040_000004.wav|I never thought I was vain about my hair, of all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being red, because it was so long and thick and curly.
700_122867_000004_000005.wav|She may be bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there's never any knowing what shape it'll break out in next.
700_122867_000004_000008.wav|Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today.
700_122867_000034_000003.wav|You can't go out with it looking like that."
700_122867_000029_000003.wav|He spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart.
700_122867_000025_000003.wav|I know what it feels like to have your word doubted.
700_122867_000032_000004.wav|They will think I am not respectable.
700_122867_000001_000001.wav|Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings.
700_122867_000000_000001.wav|Vanity and Vexation of Spirit
700_122867_000036_000006.wav|It seems such a tragic thing."
700_122867_000018_000001.wav|Never in all her life had Marilla seen anything so grotesque as Anne's hair at that moment.
700_122867_000029_000009.wav|I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he'd sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away.
700_122867_000012_000003.wav|Little things like that are of no importance now because I don't suppose I'll ever be able to go anywhere again.
700_122867_000020_000003.wav|You haven't got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due.
700_122867_000010_000000.wav|"Are you sick then?" demanded Marilla anxiously, going over to the bed.
700_122867_000042_000008.wav|I do really want to be good, Marilla, like you and mrs Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a credit to you.
700_122867_000035_000001.wav|With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.
700_122867_000005_000001.wav|"Perhaps you're judging her too hasty, Marilla.
700_122867_000013_000003.wav|This minute, I say.
700_122867_000023_000001.wav|"But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair.
700_122867_000042_000010.wav|She says she thinks it will be very becoming.
700_122867_000033_000000.wav|Anne's unhappiness continued for a week.
700_122867_000042_000011.wav|I will call it a snood-that sounds so romantic.
700_122868_000033_000004.wav|That scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday.
700_122868_000046_000006.wav|And today's mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic.
700_122868_000020_000002.wav|The flat began to leak.
700_122868_000024_000007.wav|Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her.
700_122868_000044_000000.wav|"Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla," returned Anne optimistically.
700_122868_000036_000002.wav|She almost wished she had answered Gilbert differently.
700_122868_000029_000003.wav|The girls went for help.
700_122868_000028_000002.wav|It was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!
700_122868_000028_000000.wav|Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand.
700_122868_000024_000001.wav|Why didn't somebody come?
700_122868_000020_000007.wav|Where were the oars?
700_122868_000045_000000.wav|"I don't see how," said Marilla.
700_122868_000016_000002.wav|Jane, you arrange this.
700_122868_000035_000002.wav|And I don't care either!"
700_122868_000016_000001.wav|"It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before mrs Lynde was born.
700_122868_000015_000001.wav|"It makes me feel frightened, girls.
700_122868_000019_000000.wav|The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process.
700_122868_000035_000001.wav|"I'll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley.
700_122868_000013_000001.wav|"Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane will be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot.
700_122868_000004_000001.wav|I'd be popping up every minute or so to see where I was and if I wasn't drifting too far out.
700_122868_000022_000002.wav|You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them.
700_122868_000003_000003.wav|But to lie down and pretend I was dead-I just couldn't.
700_122868_000020_000008.wav|Left behind at the landing!
700_122868_000017_000002.wav|A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of Anne's folded hands was all that could be desired.
700_122868_000012_000000.wav|Anne's plan was hailed with enthusiasm.
700_122868_000034_000000.wav|"No," she said coldly, "I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert Blythe; and I don't want to be!"
700_122868_000038_000001.wav|And Ruby is in hysterics-oh, Anne, how did you escape?"
700_122868_000013_000003.wav|We can't have the old dumb servitor because there isn't room for two in the flat when one is lying down.
700_122868_000041_000006.wav|We've gone and lost your father's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be allowed to row on the pond any more."
700_122868_000005_000001.wav|"I'm not afraid to float down and I'd love to be Elaine.
700_122868_000040_000000.wav|"Oh, Anne, how splendid of him!
700_122868_000041_000003.wav|It is all my fault.
700_122868_000018_000000.wav|"Now, she's all ready," said Jane.
700_122868_000004_000002.wav|And you know, Anne, that would spoil the effect."
700_122868_000033_000003.wav|But the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination.
700_122868_000044_000001.wav|A good cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness.
700_122868_000036_000005.wav|She was really quite unstrung, for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.
700_122868_000002_000001.wav|"I could never have the courage to float down there."
700_122868_000001_000000.wav|CHAPTER twenty eight.
700_122868_000032_000002.wav|I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time.
700_122868_000030_000000.wav|Gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance, sprang nimbly on shore.
700_122868_000005_000005.wav|Now, a red haired person cannot be a lily maid."
700_122868_000007_000002.wav|Do you think it could be called auburn now, Diana?"
700_122868_000023_000002.wav|Help would soon come, but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one.
700_122868_000022_000001.wav|I prayed, mrs Allan, most earnestly, but I didn't shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it.
700_122868_000013_000002.wav|But first you must be the brothers and the father.
700_122868_000024_000003.wav|Suppose they had fainted, one and all!
700_122868_000033_000007.wav|She hated Gilbert Blythe!
700_122868_000006_000000.wav|"Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby's," said Diana earnestly, "and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it."
700_122868_000046_000004.wav|Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity.
700_122868_000041_000000.wav|"Of course I won't," flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old spirit.
700_122868_000032_000006.wav|Let's be friends."
700_122868_000020_000006.wav|At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland.
700_122868_000046_000002.wav|The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me.
700_122868_000042_000001.wav|Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households when the events of the afternoon became known.
700_122868_000024_000002.wav|Where had the girls gone?
700_122868_000029_000000.wav|"What has happened, Anne?" asked Gilbert, taking up his oars.
700_122868_000032_000001.wav|Can't we be good friends?
700_122868_000018_000003.wav|You know Elaine 'lay as though she smiled.' That's better.
700_122868_000005_000002.wav|But it's ridiculous just the same.
700_122868_000022_000007.wav|And there I was, mrs Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down.
700_122868_000035_000000.wav|"All right!" Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his cheeks.
700_122868_000017_000000.wav|Jane rose to the occasion.
700_122868_000005_000003.wav|Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair-Elaine had 'all her bright hair streaming down,' you know.
700_122868_000022_000010.wav|I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on tight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land."
700_122868_000033_000002.wav|Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat.
700_122868_000022_000005.wav|Under such circumstances you don't think much about making a flowery prayer.
700_122868_000005_000000.wav|"But it's so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine," mourned Anne.
700_122868_000046_000001.wav|The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong to me.
700_122868_000014_000000.wav|The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast.
700_122868_000001_000001.wav|An Unfortunate Lily Maid
700_122868_000041_000004.wav|I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star.
700_122868_000021_000001.wav|There was one chance-just one.
700_122868_000024_000004.wav|Suppose nobody ever came!
700_122868_000016_000000.wav|"Ruby, you shouldn't talk about mrs Lynde," said Anne severely.
700_122868_000046_000008.wav|It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now.
700_122868_000032_000005.wav|I think your hair is awfully pretty now-honest I do.
700_122868_000003_000002.wav|It's fun then.
700_122868_000016_000003.wav|It's silly for Elaine to be talking when she's dead."
700_122868_000046_000009.wav|I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla."
700_122868_000036_000003.wav|Of course, he had insulted her terribly, but still-!
700_122868_000011_000000.wav|It was Anne's idea that they dramatize Elaine.
700_122868_000033_000000.wav|For a moment Anne hesitated.
700_122868_000018_000004.wav|Now push the flat off."
700_122868_000012_000002.wav|They had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing Elaine.
700_122868_000015_000003.wav|mrs Lynde says that all play acting is abominably wicked."
700_122868_000033_000008.wav|She would never forgive him!
700_122868_000033_000001.wav|She had an odd, newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half shy, half eager expression in Gilbert's hazel eyes was something that was very good to see.
700_122868_000010_000002.wav|It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mr Barry kept for duck shooting.
